        "report_text": "I decided to try Ayahuasca for the first time under the supervision of my partner, E, who has a lot of experience. I have a good deal of experience with all classes of drugs in general, and with psychedelics I am particularly experienced with LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, 2C-B, 2C-D, Mescaline, 5-MeO-DMT, 5-MeO-DiPT, and DMT. I've experienced DMT vaporized but I haven't really gotten much out of vaporizing it. My most meaningful and clear DMT experiences have been with IV and IM administration. \r\n\n\n\nHowever, I have been interested in ayahuasca for quite a long time and didn't really feel like it was right until I met E, who has had significant experience with it and with whom I feel safe and comfortable taking powerful psychedelics. We have explored quite a few psychedelics together, but have more recently gotten into holding space for each other. This would be one of the first times that E was going to be holding space for me.\r\n\n\n\nWe had originally planned for a one-night experience, but after the first night, I felt called to do it again, so this report has the report from day 1 and day 2. We had originally planned for a one-night experience, but after the first night, I felt called to do it again, so this report has the report from day 1 and day 2. In preparation for these experiences, I abstained from stimulants for 2 weeks, cut most dairy, sugar, and excessive salt out of my diet and ate mostly vegan. I use a small amount of kratom daily as a coffee replacement, and I also cut this back to about 1 gram per day from 2.5-3g that I usually take. I also abstained from any other mind-altering substances such as alcohol or cannabis. I did use .1mg of clonidine on occasion for sleep, but I didn't see any information regarding potential interactions with DMT. On the day before my experience, I did some journaling about my intentions and then following the experience I did some journaling to help me record my mindset going into the experience as well as record the experience so that I could refer back to it during the integration phase.\r\n\n\n\nFor the DMT dosing, E provided me a Caapi extract that contains 210mg of Tetrahydroharmine (THH) and 210mg of Harmine per dose, and we converted pure Freebase DMT into DMT Fumarate using Fumaric Acid via guides on The Nexus. On Day 1, I don't have very exact time stamps because E and I didn't think they would be necessary, but on Day 2 E decided to take detailed time-stamped notes because of the unusually large dose I decided to take.\r\n\n\n\nAyahuasca Day 1\r\n\n\n\nPre-Ayahuasca Journaling\r\n\n\n\nIn some ways, it\u0092s felt like the experience has been subtly rippling backwards through time since we set the date about two weeks back. I have noticed this in the way I\u0092m feeling about doing other drugs (less desire for them, they\u0092re not really \u0093doing it\u0094 for me like usual), in introspection and spending time with old feelings, and a general sense of calm and well being.\r\n\n\n\nThe way some events have fallen around this time has been pretty serendipitous too... first my mom coming through and bringing me boxes of things from my childhood to sort, then receiving some of my past belongings from my former partner... a very physical manifestation of baggage from my past that needs to be sorted and purged. It almost feels like a given that this is what my experience is likely to center around. It does still seem wise to reflect on some intentions.\r\n\n\n\n\u0095 Something that is very present for me right now: The physical manifestation of the baggage from my past\r\n\n\u0095 I have concerns about: difficult things coming up and not feeling \u0093resolved\u0094 by the end of the experience... when I say this, I\u0092m referencing a previous IM DMT experience where emotional abuse & sexual manipulation came up and it left me in a pretty fragile state for a while.\r\n\n\u0095 I am curious about: What it will be like to be in a DMT-type space for so long, and what the MAOIs will add to it.\r\n\n\u0095 I am inspired now to create: a clean, peaceful, beautiful space in which to enjoy the journey.\r\n\n\u0095 I am inspired to let go of: patterns, beliefs, and feelings from the past that no longer serve me.\r\n\n\u0095 In this moment I deeply desire and long for: feelings of peace and clarity about my life, and the wisdom, patience, and compassion to navigate relationships with those who have unintentionally hurt me in the past.\r\n\n\u0095 My intention: to release baggage, ill-will, fear, and insecurity. To trust the process and that all is going as it should. To feel the love that surrounds me. To experience forgiveness for others and for myself. To live in peace and help others do the same.\r\n\n\n\nPost-Ayahuasca Journaling\r\n\n\n\nt-0:20 - I took the MAOI in grapefruit juice, and laid down with an eye mask. I started to feel some mild but pleasant sensations of warmth and comfort.\r\n\n\n\nt+0:00 - I took the 50mg DMT Fumarate capsule. It wasn\u0092t long before I started to experience a sensation in my stomach... I believe when the capsule was penetrated and the contents met the rest of my stomach. It wasn\u0092t nausea (I didn\u0092t really experience much in the way of nausea the entire night), but it was a burning kind of sensation that reminded me a bit of the initial stages of food poisoning.\r\n\n\n\nI continued to pay attention to the sensations in my body and soon I began to have the initial, dim closed eye visuals that happen at the very beginning of a DMT trip. The visuals progressed quickly and before long I was fully immersed in the DMT visuals in a way that felt almost indistinguishable from IM (at doses around 40mg). This went on for a time, maybe 20 minutes (?). There was one point where I experienced a feminine presence(s) that told me they were there to help me.\r\n\n\n\nt+0:20-0:50(?) - Things started to slow down a little bit from the immersive DMT space, and I started to experience many different times & experiences from my childhood. The trip really focused on how those past experiences felt, how alone and on my own I was back then, and I started to feel extreme feelings of rage, grief, loneliness, etc. Some of the feelings, the anger & grief specifically, I felt like I experienced/embodied in almost a 3-dimensional kind of way, like a new embodied version of those emotions I'd never felt before, but I can't find precise words to explain what I mean by the 3-dimensional feeling of emotions. They were very intense and difficult emotions but it also felt really good to feel them and I welcomed them.\r\n\n\n\nThen I experienced things more from my parents\u0092 perspective, and how their situations growing up, their parents situations, etc. led to this and how they were all victims too. (I think this was around the time I started crying) I felt a desire to break this chain of suffering and I felt a lot of conviction around my decision not to have children.\r\n\n\n\nAround that time I was feeling a lot of really intense grief and sadness and loss, for myself and also for them. I also spent some time thinking about an estranged brother... the things he went through in childhood and how difficult that must have been for him and how alone he probably felt too. I experienced grief that he wasn\u0092t in my life but understanding and empathy for why he didn\u0092t want anything to do with our family. I wished him the peace and healing that he needs.\r\n\n\n\nI had the desire to let go of some of the hurt and suffering from childhood and I felt forgiveness towards my brother, my parents, and myself. I also spent some time feeling really deep love and empathy for my childhood self. I promised her that she never had to be alone again and she never had to feel that way again.\r\n\n\n\nt+1:00 - I think this was about the time I took the booster capsule (35mg), though I never noticed any additional effects.\r\n\nThere was a bit of a break where I was listening to the icaros that were playing through the speaker in our room... my visuals were much fainter by this point, but they were beautiful and intricate and it felt like the song WAS the visuals.\r\n\n\n\nAfter a time, I started to go back into the experience. For a little while, things started to turn towards my relationship with my ex-partner. I experienced parts of the early times in our relationship and I felt a lot of anger and disgust towards him. I started to feel a little bit around what his childhood was like. However, it didn\u0092t last very long... it almost felt like my relationship with my ex-partner is such a mountain of things to feel and untangle, and there were some other things I had to get through before I could turn my full attention to it. Instead, I began to focus my attention on one of my oldest best friends. Lots of grief and anger and confusion. How completely in love I was with her and how cold she was and frequently totally shut down towards me. The confusion of the really warm and intimate times we would have followed rapidly by her taking out her anger on me (and her partner, whoever that was at the time). Reflecting now, it almost feels a bit similar to a pattern with my mom... of course I was never anywhere near as close to my mom as I was to my best friend, but I can see a kind of similar dynamic where she would occasionally tell me things like \u0093you can tell me anything\u0094 or have a random small moment of affection but then right back to shutting me out and rejecting me. It felt really hurtful and inconsistent and confusing.\r\n\n\n\nt+3:00 - After I processed these different relationships, the trip was definitely dying down at this point and it was getting more difficult to stay focused and feel the feelings, but I also experienced a lot of empathy for the things my best friend has been through in her life that have brought these things out in her, and forgave her. I explored what it might feel like to let go of any expectations around that relationship, and let go of having to always be the one to come back and reach out and make the effort to be there... but, I realized that I\u0092m not ready to do that, I\u0092m not sure if I\u0092ll ever be ready to do that, and I forgave myself for that and appreciated the part of myself that doesn\u0092t give up on the people I love.\r\n\n\n\nThe whole experience felt very cathartic. I feel like a made a lot of progress, but also that there is a lot of work left to do, which is why I am strongly considering doing it again. I would like the opportunity to address my time with my ex-partner... I think it might also be good for me to spend some time with the early days of my relationship with E.\r\n\n\n\nt+4:30 - At the end of the trip, I was exhausted in a way that felt like I was on the tail end of being on a very large dose of stimulants. I was concerned about being able to sleep... I took 2 skullcap extract tablets and .1mg clonidine, but had a very difficult time falling asleep. I ended up taking another .1mg of clonidine at some point and finally managed to drift off, but all night I was dreaming about ayahuasca... mainly in the dreams, I was trying to have another experience to finish what I started but the medicine wasn\u0092t working.\r\n\n\n\nI woke up around 6:30 after around 5 hours of sleep feeling a lot of inflammation in my body, especially in my sinuses. I still felt pretty physically restless and tired but I\u0092ve taken some ibuprofen and I\u0092m drinking a lot of water.\r\n\n\n\nAyahuasca day 2\r\n\n\n\nPre-Ayahuasca Journaling\r\n\n\n\nI have decided to do this again today because I didn\u0092t feel like I finished everything I needed to yesterday.\r\n\n\n\nI would appreciate the opportunity to process some things around my time with my ex-partner... but I am also remaining open to whatever comes up.\r\n\n\n\n\u0095 Something that is very present for me right now: physical tiredness\r\n\n\u0095 I have concerns about: bypassing or dissociating instead of integrating my feelings\r\n\n\u0095 I am curious about: how today\u0092s experience might differ from yesterday\u0092s\r\n\n\u0095 I am inspired now to create: space to feel\r\n\n\u0095 I am inspired to let go of: expectations for myself around what I should be accomplishing through this experience\r\n\n\u0095 In this moment I deeply desire and long for: patience with myself\r\n\n\u0095 My intention: to allow myself to feel things for as long as I need to, and not try to rush myself through the process.\r\n\n\n\nNotes from Day 2 Ayahuasca experience: The following is a mix of my notes the day after the experience, and time stamps/notes that E took for me while she was sitting for me. Notes in quotes are from E's notes and the rest is from my journaling. E used the letter \"O\" to refer to me.\r\n\n\n\nt-0:20 - Dosed THH + Harmine in grapefruit juice.\r\n\n\n\nt+:0:00 - Dosed 60mg DMT Fumarate in gel cap.\r\n\n\n\nt+0:20 - \"20 minutes after taking DMT, O was worried about whether she should be feeling the DMT yet. Reassured her she had plenty of time before feeling it (45 minutes is come on time).\"\r\n\n\n\n*To start my notes, I want to circle back around to the dream I mentioned that I had last night after my first session. That dream turned out to be not just a dream but a startlingly accurate vision of the first part of what happened on night 2.*\r\n\n\n\nI was feeling more restless and anxious this time around, very eager for it to start. I kept waiting and waiting but not much was happening and I was becoming increasingly frustrated (this was the part I had seen in the dream). I wondered if my brain somehow had the ability to subconsciously block the effects of the medicine. There were some mild and subtle signs that I was altered, but I wasn\u0092t getting any visuals or any of what I would consider the DMT part of the experience. There were some mild and subtle signs that I was altered, but I wasn\u0092t getting any visuals or any of what I would consider the DMT part of the experience. \n\n\n\nt+1:30 - \"O took another 210mg THH, 210mg Harmine, and an additional 20mg Harmaline because she hadn\u0092t noticed any psychedelic effect. She also requested another dose of 60mg DMT Fumarate, which was administered at t+1:45.\"\r\n\n\n\nI decided to redose with the same dose I started with, plus some harmaline. This time, things started to happen pretty quickly though the true peak still took a little while to fully come on and it was still different from the first night. The first night, the initial peak was indistinguishable from IM DMT, but this time the visual/immersive effects were dulled somewhat (though went on for muuuch longer).\r\n\n\n\nt+2:00 - \"O said there were more peak-like effects starting but it felt less than day 1.\"\r\n\n\n\nT+2:14 - \"O seems more restless, taking deeper breaths, fidgeting more. Looks struggling to get comfortable, breathing heavy. Right arm moving around a lot. Both arms out.\"\r\n\n\n\nIt was around this time (2 hrs, 14 min into the night, according to E's log) that things began to get extremely difficult and uncomfortable. The feeling was like something was trying to rip my mind away from my body. It was ceaseless and so completely overstimulating. It didn\u0092t let up ever for even a second, for hours. I felt like I was fighting for my mind and I couldn\u0092t relax or let my guard down ever. In addition, there was so much energy and tension in my body that I kept thrashing and writhing around and couldn\u0092t get comfortable. My hands kept trying to wander away and take my mind with them. E kept returning them to my core and telling me to stay with my body and return to my breath. This was very helpful and I clung to that advice and used my breath to help keep me anchored. I had to remind myself over and over and over again.\r\n\n\n\nAt one point E put some pressure on my body and that felt really soothing.\r\n\n\n\nSometimes she would spritz me with the scented water and that was also really helpful... the cool mist hitting my skin gave me another anchor.\r\n\n\n\nT+2:25 - \"movements have calmed down a bit, deep sighs and heavy breaths are still happening.\"\r\n\n\n\nT+2:57 - \"knees pulled close to chest, heavy breathing, sighing. Then some stillness. Looks like some fighting has eased. Then resuming heavy short breaths.\"\r\n\n\n\nT+3:22 - \"turned face down towards elbow, covering eyes with hand, holding onto eye mask. Labored short breaths continuing.\"\r\n\n\n\nSometime during all of this, I\u0092m not sure exactly when, time gets a little confusing, I was having a very vivid and consuming DMT experience that went on for some time and continued to linger through the very end... I don\u0092t really even know how to describe it. It involved \u0093joisting\u0094, and word that repeated itself in my head over and over again, there was \u0093vanquishing\u0094... victory and glory and hype and colors and sound and energy. Almost psychedelic Mad-Max.\r\n\n\n\nAfter this point, the order of my experience is a bit unclear so I'll write the most of my memory of it after the E's timestamps.\r\n\n\n\nT+3:28 - \"having some hand holding.\"\r\n\n\n\nT+3:31 - \"right hand \u0093claw\u0094 made an appearance again briefly.\"\r\n\n\n\nT+4:00 - \"calming down a bit but still not verbal. Still taking deep sudden breaths.\"\r\n\n\n\nT+4:24 - \"calming down more, drinking water, still having moments of deep forceful breaths, like she\u0092s not getting enough air. Still not much verbal ability.\"\r\n\n\n\nT+5:00 - \"purge, and then gradual coming down.\"\r\n\n\n\nAt some point (again, the order of events is very foggy), I finally purged which felt really good to do. It felt like flushing a lot of old toxic shit out.\r\n\n\n\nT+5:46 - \"not fully down, slight headache and not fully verbal but able to make requests. Eye mask back on due to light sensitivity. Some chocolate and some banana eaten. Sipping on water autonomously since purge.\"\r\n\n\n\nT+6:06 - \"went to bathroom with some assistance\"\r\n\n\n\nT6:21 - \"She\u0092s laughing and cracking jokes again\"\r\n\n\n\nRemainder of my notes from T+3:28 onward:\r\n\n\n\nThere were a couple times when I opened my eyes and E's cat was there, staring deeply into my soul, and this helped anchor me too. She really felt like E\u0092s familiar.\r\n\n\n\nThere finally came a time when the fighting was fractionally less intense (though still a constant struggle). I was able to turn towards E and use her presence to keep me tethered. She was SO rock solid and steady and unwavering and I felt an overwhelming love and gratefulness towards her. This is when the lessons started.\r\n\n\n\nI could feel my relationship and trust with E healing old attachment wounds. It was so beautiful. I was taught a lot about being present with my emotions and allowing myself to feel them and be present with them. I was shown that I don\u0092t often feel safe experiencing anger, but that it can be a valuable emotion.\r\n\nI was taught about asking for what I need.\r\n\nI was taught about sharing my feelings with E (and in general).\r\n\nI was taught about patience with myself.\r\n\nI was taught about patience with E. I had this realization that when E says she\u0092s working on something about herself, I can trust that she\u0092s doing it on her timeline and I don\u0092t need to worry about whether it\u0092s going to happen... I just need to have patience and trust that it will. She is a true partner and she\u0092s holding down her side.\r\n\n\n\nI also really grokked what often says about making this relationship a safe harbor, and about being on the same team.\r\n\nI had a good look at the part of myself that picks fights sometimes.\r\n\n\n\nAll these beautiful lessons and E showing up for me so hard during the entire experience. She always knew exactly what to do or say and I just felt her solid presence the whole time like an absolute rock. So beautiful it makes me want to cry. I can only hope to come anywhere close to giving her the same gift one day.\r\n\n\n\nAnyway... by this point I was exhausted. I was still struggling consistently to keep my mind and not slip back into the chaotic DMT space, but the struggle was becoming less intense. The energy and restlessness was still there but not as bad. I had a pretty bad headache at this point and was very light sensitive. I really wanted to put my eyemask on, but being able to make eye contact with E was the main thing keeping me anchored and I was so afraid that if I closed my eyes I would slip away again.\r\n\n\n\nE kept telling me I needed to eat and made me some soup, but I was really struggling. My stomach didn\u0092t want food and the soup was making me queasy. Blueberries were easier but I was so exhausted that eating them was very difficult. Finally E ended up spooning the soup into my mouth which was very sweet and helpful, I\u0092m not sure if I could have gotten it down otherwise.\r\n\n\n\nAfter this we cuddled, which felt really nice.\r\n\n\n\nAs I was finally coming down from the experience, E showed me a poem that resonated so deeply...\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Sleeping With You\r\n\n\n\nIs there anything more wonderful?\r\n\nAfter we have floundered through our separate pain\r\n\nwe come to this. I bind myself to you, like otters wrapped in kelp, so the current will not steal us as we sleep.\r\n\nThrough the night we turn together, rocked in the shallow surf, pebbles polished by the sea.\r\n\n\n\n-Ellen Bass\u0094\r\n\n\n\nIt has me considering ways to incorporate otters into my tattoo sleeve. (Before this experience, I wondered if I might come out of it with some kind of idea about what I wanted to symbolize on that arm.)\r\n\n\n\nSleep was not coming to me and I spent more time thrashing. At this point it was around 4am and I was giving up hope of any sleep at all. E finally convinced me to get up and do some yoga, and that was really helpful. She was right that my body was able to settle down after that and eventually I did fall asleep for about an hour and a half, before I got hungry and got up to eat and shower and journal. Even at 7-8am, I was still getting mild waves of flickery light and unsteadiness. I am feeling surprisingly ok though so far on 1.5 hrs of sleep, though I imagine I\u0092ll need to nap later. It\u0092s almost 9 now and I\u0092m still experiencing frequent waves of restless energy, I may need to do more yoga.  \r\n\n\n\nOverall I am feeling profoundly grateful and at peace and present.\r\n\n\n\n~.~.~\r\n\n\n\nEven with the severe lack of sleep, I've had a surprising amount of energy pretty consistently throughout the day following my second dosing session. I started to get pretty sleepy around 6pm, but it's now almost 9 and I'm feeling pretty energetic again. Hopefully I can get some sleep tonight since I've got work in the morning.\r\n\n\n\nI can definitely see wanting to experience this medicine again, though I imagine it may be 3-5 years out."

        "report_text": "I should start off by saying that I did not emotionally or mentally prepare for this trip in anyway. This was my first time using DMT and changa and I didn\u0092t want to spoil the experience with expectations (or at least that\u0092s what I told myself. More than likely, I was just lazy). I had read a few DMT experience reports in the past, so I broadly knew what was going to happen. But it had been over 6 months since I read any of those reports and the details were hazy at best. After having carried the substances around with me for years, I casually decided now was the perfect time to try them. \r\n\n\n\nWhile I drastically prefer dissociatives, I\u0092m no stranger to tryptamines or phenethylamines. With these classes of drugs, most of my experience stems from a myriad of research chemicals. I have never done mushrooms and have only tripped on LSD a couple of times. I personally find it very difficult to \u0091let go\u0092 while on psychedelics, with the exception of dissociatives (thus my strong affinity towards them). Nevertheless, on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, I decided DMT was right for me.\r\n\n\n\nMy partner, Anatoli Smorin, and I built a \u0091The Machine\u0092 to smoke the crystal DMT while the changa was loaded into a simple glass bowl. The changa was sourced from an individual who had recently returned from South America. It was reported to consist of Banisteriopsis caapi and N,N-DMT. I took the vendor for their word and did not have a third party test the substance. The setting for this is a beautiful 20acre property tucked up against my favorite mountain range in a town I call Home. I relaxed against an apple tree in the orchard and began my experience. \r\n\n\n\n\n\nT 00:00\r\n\nI pack 138 mg of changa in the bowl and light it with a normal bic lighter. I take one deep inhale and attempt to hold my breath. As someone who no longer smokes weed, I find the physical act of smoking to be quite painful. My lungs burn and I cough everything out. Anatoli laughs at me and encourages me to take another hit. \r\n\n\n\nT 00:03\r\n\nI inhale again, this time trying to hold my breath for as long as possible. Smoking is painful and stupid and I don\u0092t enjoy any of it. But this time I manage to keep it in for a little bit longer. Instantly, I find my field of vision changing. I see the wind gently tangling with the leaves, leaving pastel trails in its wake. The visuals are soft and gentle. A wind chime sings in the distance. How nice it would be to stay here forever. I see the wind gently tangling with the leaves, leaving pastel trails in its wake. The visuals are soft and gentle. A wind chime sings in the distance. How nice it would be to stay here forever. \n\n\n\nT 00:05\r\n\n37 mg of DMT has been melted into the \u0091The Machine\u0092. Anatoli holds one end while I grab onto the plastic tubing that we have installed as a mouthpiece to allow Anatoli to vaporize the material while I focus on inhaling. Am I really about to smoke DMT? All of the sudden, I find this to be quite an extreme Sunday activity. Clearly, I am not a church going individual. I inhale and cough. I inhale again, this time with Anatoli gently telling me to keep holding it, keep holding it for one more second. \r\n\n\n\nT 00:06\r\n\nI inhale again and again. I\u0092m not sure how many hits I take, but I eventually shake my head to signal that I\u0092m done. I briefly smell a burnt smell before everything goes dark.\r\n\n\n\nT 00:07\r\n\nInstantly my world narrows. Gone are the apple trees and warm summer breeze. I\u0092m not sure I even have a physical body anymore. And yet, I feel as if I can\u0092t breathe. Whatever is left of my body isn\u0092t functioning. I curl up on myself and have to physically force myself to take in gulps of air. I\u0092m in a void. I see nothing, feel nothing, beyond my lack of breath. I squeeze my eyes shut, or have they been shut the whole time? I\u0092m not sure anymore. I\u0092m in a void. I see nothing, feel nothing, beyond my lack of breath. I squeeze my eyes shut, or have they been shut the whole time? I\u0092m not sure anymore. I logically try to tell myself that my body will naturally take over if I can only allow it. Then I can enjoy this experience. But I can\u0092t. I can\u0092t let go of this simple, lifesaving task. If I do, I know I won\u0092t make it. I\u0092ll suffocate and forever be lost in this void, this vacuum of light and air.\r\n\n\n\nAll I see is blackness. Each inhale is remarkably difficult.  It\u0092s as if my lungs no longer work on their own. They don\u0092t remember how to expand and contract. I\u0092m filled with this primal need for air and yet somehow I can\u0092t seem to get enough. I\u0092m drowning, desperately trying to keep my head above some body of water that I can\u0092t see or touch. I\u0092m starting to panic. I think I\u0092m hyperventilating. \r\n\n\n\nA thought floats into my consciousness. Is this what it\u0092s like to die in space? How have I managed to travel so far from home? \r\n\n\n\nAs quickly as the thought comes, it\u0092s gone. Breathe, just keep trying to breathe. It feels as if I\u0092m pushing my chest outwards, from inside my body. I have to physically force it to expand, to allow in air. There is no such thing as time or Earth or anything else except my need to keep breathing. Nothing else exists or has existed or will ever exist again. There is only blackness and asphyxiation. \r\n\n\n\nBeyond my lungs and chest cavity, I have no other awareness of my body. My spine, skull, and nervous system are gone. The only sounds I can hear are my desperate gasps. I\u0092m fighting a battle I know I cannot win. I can only hope that I will be transported somewhere away from here. Somewhere with color. Breathe, breathe, breathe\u0085\r\n\n\n\nT 00:09\r\n\nI open my eyes and it\u0092s over. I\u0092m back to my gentle pastel visuals. Some light fractals remain on the grass and trees, but none of the visuals are overt or pressing. I feel as if only seconds have passed. I\u0092m slightly disoriented from the experience. What just happened? I feel calm, yet I\u0092m breathing heavily. There\u0092s a slight burning in my chest and esophagus from the smoke but no other body load or sensations. I turn to Anatoli and tell him I want to try it again. Soon. Now. \r\n\n\n\nT 00:10\r\n\nWe don\u0092t have any more DMT in crystal form, but we have more changa. We make the decision to take a small break and regroup at the front of the property to watch the sunset over the surrounding mountains. \r\n\n\n\nT 00:15\r\n\nI ruminate on the experience I just had.  Even though it happened only moments ago, the memory feels hazy. Like a traumatic event my brain is trying to protect me from.  And yet, I have this strange desire to do it again. Even though it happened only moments ago, the memory feels hazy. Like a traumatic event my brain is trying to protect me from.  And yet, I have this strange desire to do it again. Like I\u0092ve only scratched the surface and if given a second chance, I know I could fly. \r\n\n\n\nNow that I\u0092ve had a moment to take a step back, I\u0092m flabbergasted by the intensity and timeframe of the drug\u0092s effects. Going from 0mph to 100mph is not something I was prepared for. It\u0092s like my memory of riding a roller coaster for the first time. I think I\u0092m ready but nothing has prepared me for the first initial drop, where my stomach lurches into my throat and I feel as if I\u0092m free falling. It\u0092s in that moment that I\u0092m forced to surrender to gravity, or DMT, in this instance. So, yes, I had read about the quickness and intensity of DMT, but experiencing it is something else entirely. \r\n\n\n\nT 00:25\r\n\nAnatoli and I reconvene at the front of the property. There\u0092s a magnificent sunset happening, with bright, vibrant colors filling the sky, against a backdrop of multiple mountain ranges. I\u0092m filled with a sense of awe at the beauty around me. I can tell the alpenglow will be spectacular tonight. Anatoli packs 151 mg of changa into the bowl. Our conversation is light and easy. We reflect on the different mountain ranges we can see and how lucky we are to live in such an area. \r\n\n\n\nT00:27\r\n\nI light the changa and inhale. I\u0092m able to hold the smoke in for roughly 5 seconds before I cough it out. Seems like I still haven\u0092t learned how to hold my breath! Anatoli comments that he usually hates the taste of DMT. I don\u0092t taste anything, but for the first time I notice how distinct the smell is. It\u0092s pungent and sharp and slightly unpleasant; it smells synthetic, as if we are burning plastic. \r\n\n\n\nSome light visuals start to unfold before me. The mountain ranges seem to hold an indescribable amount of depth to them. They are silent yet ever looming in the distance. They are my witness to this experience and I\u0092m happy to have their presence near me. I look up and notice the single cloud in the sky. It\u0092s filled with layers of color. I feel as if I\u0092m in a Monet painting, my vision taken over with texture and bold brushstrokes. Every color blends into the one next to it, creating movement between everything, despite an actual lack of activity. \r\n\n\n\nT 00:30\r\n\nI take another inhale of changa. Anatoli verbally counts to 10 to make sure I hold my breath long enough this time. I struggle but succeed. Instantly, my vision shifts. I hear a buzzing, as if a bee where circling around my head. I lose sight of the mountains and the cloud. Fuck Monet, my world has been upgraded to Alex Grey! Red and black fractals explode into my vision. Literally everything I see is replaced by these fractals. And each has a smiling face. While they are bold and present, they are not frightening. Everywhere I look, the smiling fractals stare back at me. They\u0092ve somehow consumed my eyesight, taking over everything I see. The more I look, the more 3-D they become. My visual world is now deconstructing and rearranging to form a red and black fractal orb around me. My visual world is now deconstructing and rearranging to form a red and black fractal orb around me. I realize this is not the first orb I have been in. The first time I experienced orb-ism was on a very high dose of N-Ethylnorketamine. As I sit in the center of this ball, I no longer hear, see, or feel the normal world around me. And yet, the fractals continue to smile at me with their goofy grins. The smiles, while friendly, are almost manic. And there\u0092s so so so many of them. \r\n\n\n\nI\u0092m breathing heavily again. A thought from before caresses my mind. If I don\u0092t force myself to breath, I\u0092ll stop breathing altogether. However, unlike before, I\u0092m able to let go of this notion and simply enjoy the experience for what it is. After a few deep breathes and a second of acclimation, I realize I\u0092m fine. \r\n\n\n\nThis realization rewards me unparalleled visuals. The fractals break apart to reveal the mountains, which have grown in size, depth, and color. Each peak dances and shifts with the peaks next to it. There\u0092s two layers, no three layers, no four layers of mountains in front of me. How have I never noticed this before! My love for these giant rocks in the sky grows with each passing second. I\u0092m no longer miles away from them, but right at their base. As the sun continues to set, their colors shift from grey to blue to purple, all the while dancing and moving. Each peak seamlessly shimmies and shakes with the peak next to it, to some hidden beat I cannot hear. I can tell from their movements that it\u0092s upbeat and I catch myself bobbing my head along. I get the feeling that it\u0092s some kind of funk song, with a killer saxophone solo. I laugh and think that I\u0092ll never be able to look at these mountains in the same way. \r\n\n\n\nI somehow convince myself to look upwards and see the stars above me. Even though the sun is still up, and I can\u0092t see the actual stars, I can see thousands of rotating octagons formed of a shimmering golden color. Their rotations are slow and lackadaisical. They have no hurry and no other purpose than to simply exist as they are. Their edges connect to one another, creating a web of shifting light in the baby blue sky. \r\n\n\n\nT 00:34\r\n\nThe more intense visuals fade and I\u0092m slowly brought back to my world of Monet. The sun is fully behind the mountains and the sky erupts with hues of pink, blue, orange, and purple. I take a deep breath, to reground myself in this moment in time. I\u0092m so incredibly thankful to be here. To witness this sunset. To be given such a gift from the universe. I can\u0092t remember the last time I have felt so peaceful. I can\u0092t remember the last time I have felt so peaceful. \n\n\n\nT 00:36\r\n\nThe alpenglow has begun. The valley I\u0092m in becomes silent, as if every being is acknowledging the slow shift from daytime to nighttime. The temperature drops in response. \r\n\n\n\nT 00:37\r\n\nI notice for the first time two horses grazing in their pastures. I\u0092ve met these horses before and their owner is my dear friend. While usually very standoffish, these horses instantly greet me as I walk to the fence separating us. They don\u0092t let me pet them but they look at me as I softly speak to them. I wish them a good evening and hope they\u0092re enjoying their open pasture. We both know in a couple of weeks the grass will be covered in frost. Summers are fleeting here and winters come in swiftly. But for now, we all enjoy this easy weather. I murmur a final goodbye and with that, both horses turn away and start grazing again. \r\n\n\n\nT 00:45\r\n\nMy visuals are back to baseline now. I\u0092m left with a sense of calm. Life seems unusually easy. I\u0092m aware that this will shift by tomorrow, but for now I appreciate the feeling and welcome it with open arms. \r\n\n\n\nT 00:45+ \r\n\nThe rest of the evening is spent with grilling, eating, and laughing with Anatoli. I don\u0092t feel any adverse effects from the changa and DMT. My mood is light and easy going for the rest of the night. I have a normal appetite and have no issues falling asleep. I wake up feeling rested and ready for the day.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the whole experience took less than an hour, there seemed to be two juxtaposing sides \u0096 one filled with blackness and a lack of air and the other consumed by color and an awe of nature. Yet, somehow, it felt comfortable to bounce from one to another. Even with my breathing issues, I immediately wanted to go further and deeper. Even in the world of darkness, I never once classified my trip as bad or unpleasant. For the first time, a tryptamine had knocked me on my ass \u0096physically, emotionally, and visually. And I enjoyed it. Even in the world of darkness, I never once classified my trip as bad or unpleasant. For the first time, a tryptamine had knocked me on my ass \u0096physically, emotionally, and visually. And I enjoyed it. \n\n\n\nAn aspect I particularly enjoyed was the very little body load I experienced. Outside of dissociatives, this was the first chemical that allowed me to push my limits without being hindered by my dislike of a body high. Any type of body high sends me directly into a ball on the couch. Finally, I was able to let go.\r\n\n\n\nI found DMT to be very unique in intensity and quickness of onset. The visuals were very tryptamine in nature but I have yet to find a dosage in other substances of this class that provided comparable intensity. This includes exploration with 4-AcO-DMT in the 50+mg range in combination with agents of propulsion, such as nitrous oxide and cannabis. While obviously intense in their own manner, the visual intensity of these experiences did not hold a flame to the earth shattering adventure I had today. \r\n\n\n\nI feel as if I barely scratched the surface of possibilities with these substances. I have many more miles to go and I can\u0092t wait to see where the journey takes me."

        "report_text": "This experience happened nearly a year ago to date and while some of the smaller details may have slipped from memory, I believe what I experienced that night was powerful enough that I can still describe what happened to me with the detail and accuracy that I feel this trip report deserves. However, given the time that has passed some blanks may need to be filled in and I will do this the best I can. While I was on methoxetamine, the true beauty of this night and what I want to describe to you in more detail was my DMT breakthrough. If you happen to read this trip report all the way through, I hope I can successfully convey even just a fraction of the awe and feeling that I felt that night.\r\n\n\n\nDMT had always been something I had wanted to experience, and I had read about it for years before actually trying it. On one occasion prior to this experience, I actually did try it, but I didn\u0092t breakthrough to the hyperspace I had read about, I just had visuals and a body feeling that I wouldn\u0092t call entirely enjoyable, just strange. Yet I was still pretty determined to get to that place and see what the hype was about so last summer I bought a kilo of mimosa root bark and extracted my own DMT. I didn\u0092t get as much as I expected but it was still at least a couple grams of white fluffy DMT to experiment with. Yet as excited as I was to attempt a breakthrough, for some reason I was just too scared to go all the way. I\u0092d take a hit and get that strange feeling in my body which kind of intimidated me, and then I would back out from going farther. Doing DMT and not breaking through still gives me open eye visuals, it is just too weird of feeling for me to enjoy and I get a prickly sensation all over plus the taste and smell of burnt plastic is just off putting.\r\n\n\n\nAround this time last year was also when I was first introduced to methoxetamine. While I wouldn\u0092t call myself experienced with it, I was comfortable using it and had been in what some might described as an \u0093M-Hole.\u0094 From the couple times I had tried it before, I found it took about 100mg to get me fully dissociated and in to a hole. At the time I lived in a bit of a party house and it happened to be a work night so it was actually quiet for once. I decided to take advantage of the peace and calm and weighed out about 75mg of MXE at what I want to say was about 9 in the evening, and then insufflated it. \r\n\n\n\nThe come up of MXE takes forever for me, about an hour to really start getting in to the trip and about two hours to peak, and from there I\u0092m really messed up for another two hours or so and then begin to get my head back. It find it to be a pretty relaxing substance over all, and my favorite thing to do on it is simply turn on some tunes and just lay in my bed in the dark wrapped in blankets and let the chemical overtake me. I proceeded to do just that, making my bed comfy and I then turned on a local college radio station that plays a lot of mellow tunes from just about any genre you can imagine, but mostly Indy and local stuff I\u0092ve never heard before. I find that station meshes well with the MXE experience and little did I know then, it would come to shape the most memorable moment of my night.\r\n\n\n\nAs the time passed I began to drift ever farther from reality. When I closed my eyes, new worlds would seem to appear before me, worlds of color and texture. Even though I\u0092m laying down, it feels as if I\u0092m spinning head over heal and I truly begin to float through these worlds. The music from the stereo shaped the colors and would shift the textures in these worlds. While I was very intoxicated, I could still open my eyes and recognize where I was and was capable of getting up and moving, albeit without much coordination. After what I would say was about three hours, the trip was no longer getting more intense, but it was still going strong, and for some reason, the DMT that was stashed in my cabinet came to mind. I thought what the hell, why not.\r\n\n\n\nThe methoxetamine had me quite intoxicated, and the thought of smoking DMT did not make me feel intimidated like it had every other time. I pretty much stumbled across the room, and proceed to weigh out what I believe was about 75mg of DMT, and put it on top of a small amount of weed in my bowl. I go back to my bed, put the covers over me, and take a deep breath. I applied the flame to the bowl, lightly touching the DMT with the lighter and inhale a huge hit of the rather unpleasant tasting and smelling smoke. \r\n\n\n\nI spend all day mowing for my job, and suddenly these two still frames of my boss and the mower I use at work flash through my brain, like moving snapshots. While I didn\u0092t have time to think about it then, I now think it was my brain attempting to hold on to some form of the reality that it had always known, and since I spent most of my day on a mower, that\u0092s what came to mind most readily. After this the world went blank and I felt an energy flowing through my body, although I was not aware of my body I could still feel this power flowing through me. Then quite suddenly what I can only describe as a grid enveloped everything around me, while the background was still black, the lines of the grid were coming more and more in to focus.\r\n\n\n\nAs all this was happening, I could still think about what was occurring with some semblance of rational thought although I did not remember taking any drug and was both unaware and unconcerned of my body, despite this odd pulsating energy vibrating through me. At first I was somewhat panicked, I thought to myself, boy you really did it this time you really took it too far now, there\u0092s no going back now. As these thoughts crossed my mind the grid then began to morph and change. Patterns and shapes started to come from it, but they were not clearly defined, it was as if a cloak was over top of them that bent the light around their true shape. A shape would emerge then it felt as if the grid would make a ninety degree turn in front of me, and new shapes would emerge, I was entirely powerless to interfere with what was happening around me. Colors began to emerge in the shapes and I explicitly remember pink and green being the most prominent and they were incredibly vivid. I can still remember the way they struck me now, but could never describe in words what they looked like besides pink and green and were shaped.\r\n\n\n\nThen this feeling came over me, a feeling that what I was seeing was an ancient place. While visually it looked sharp and futuristic, I had an overwhelming feeling that it was older than time. This might sound odd, but it reminded me of what I mentally picture as a 1950s soda shop, but much more mystic and magical of course. Like everything is outlined in chrome and it is all flashy and new looking, but it still has the retro feel. It\u0092s the best I can describe it but the ancient feeling of where I was at sharply contrasted the futuristic visuals that were occurring. I was still stupefied about what was going on, but I slowly began to realize that what was happening wasn\u0092t a bad thing, in fact it was somewhat pleasant, and accepted my fate that this was reality now, or perhaps how it had always been, for all I knew at that point. In that instant of acceptance the energy that was going through my body snapped and cracked and the pulse in my body became a steady surge, it was as if I was finally plugged in to everything. I thought to myself, this is it, this is what every human in history has strived to reach, this place here is the point of existence. While what was going on around me was visually crazy and it was mentally confounding, I accepted it and I felt it accept me back. Something just felt right about it, I keep calling it the beautiful chaos, and that\u0092s just the perfect way to describe it.\r\n\n\n\nThen, I found that something quite strange began to occur, I believe even for the DMT hyperspace that was expanding within my mind. Out of the corners of this alternate universe, music began to play, and I even recognized the lyrics: \u0093I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.\u0094 It was the freaking Beatles playing the song I Am the Walrus, and out of all the places for this to be playing, it was happening HERE? I couldn\u0092t make sense of it and I actually thought to myself that if I was in heaven right now, God must really like the Beatles. The universe was still very much alive with color and movement, even more than it was before, but despite the confusion and beautiful chaos that was happening around me, I could understand every single word that was in that song and I knew it was the Beatles. I was pretty dumfounded about why it was playing, and I\u0092m not sure at what point in the song that it entered my consciousness, but it must have been toward the end. At one point it does a sudden twist in the beat, and as this was happening, the song just shattered everything that was before me. There was no longer a grid, it was as if someone shattered it like glass and shards of color were rippling and then exploding from every direction. Then from all this beautiful chaos, it appeared as if a group of people were coming from it, though I could only get a brief glimpse of their outline.\r\n\n\n\nThen just as suddenly as it happened, I was back in my room, sitting in my bed against the wall with the bowl lying beside me on the sheets it honestly took me a couple minutes to get my bearings back. Okay I told myself, you are in your room, which is in the city I live in, back on planet Earth. I was still tripping very hard and there were crazy ripples of light everywhere and a lot of morphing, but I was no longer in hyperspace, I was back in my room. Then I heard the radio on, which was responsible for the Beatles just blowing my mind and it finally made sense why it was playing. As soon I was a little more settled, I grabbed my phone and called my best friend. I proceeded to tell him I finally broke through, and all I could say after was \u0093Holy shit, what the fuck, oh my God,\u0094 and I repeated those three phrase for at least twenty minutes, it really was all I could say. After that I called my girlfriend told her anyways that the most amazing thing ever had just happened and it was incredible! I was just absolutely ecstatic and I felt recharged, like I was truly alive for the first time in years! It was unbelievable!\r\n\n\n\nI believe the MXE was still coursing through my system, because I tripped for quite a while longer, it synergized very well with the DMT and I just sat on the couch taking deep breaths staring at the ceiling watching the fireworks. I can\u0092t say how much of an impact it had on my breakthrough, I\u0092m sure it had some, but I feel as though the DMT completely overpowered it for the time that I was out. I continued to just feel really good for quite a while but eventually I fell asleep around 4 a.m., and woke up bright and early for work with a couple things on my mind I could never possibly convey to co-workers. For only having a couple hours of sleep, I felt pretty good if not a bit wobbly still from the MXE, and all I could think about for the next few days was what in the hell happened to me.\r\n\n\n\nThe experience itself was one of the most powerful experiences of my life, and no other psychedelic has even touched what DMT did to me. Although I had a couple grams of DMT left, I have never even really smoked any of it again. I was hesitant to breakthrough to begin with, and now I\u0092m equally hesitant to go back now that I know how powerful DMT is. If I had to describe it I\u0092d compare it to how I imagine someone might describe skydiving, it is just getting out the door that\u0092s scary, but once you do you are in for a ride. Regardless it\u0092s something I\u0092ll be forever grateful to have experienced, but I\u0092m satisfied with having experienced it. The DMT was just soooooo powerful to go back so soon, even a year later, though one day I will return. With the remaining grams, I have introduced several friends to the world that is DMT and let them get a taste of what it means to really live, something I think everyone should try at least to know it is there.\r\n\n\n\nAnd besides, now every time I hear I Am the Walrus I am instantly filled with nostalgia and the feelings come back from that fateful night"

        "report_text": "It\u0092s a fairly sober and sunny Sunday afternoon in the apartment like most any other, but in my brightest intentions and most thought out plans I\u0092ve something dark and wild in store.\r\n\n\n\nThe wish is to recreate the conditions of the plus ++++ experience I had had in the past, when I had last successfully mixed DMT and mescaline.  All attempts succeeding that one\u0097wherein I manically thought: \u0093my sensorium is a sun-rapt field\u0097fox fur fine and silk sheets sensual\u0097that I\u0092m being lovingly dragged through by a ballistic missile\u0094\u0097had been frustratingly lacking due to unpredictable mimosa timing and effectiveness, or involuntarily aborted in an eruption of too-soon green cactus barf.  Reaching it again has consumed me spiritually.  \r\n\n\n\nBut I have it figured it out now.  I will eat far less cactus by using syrian rue (an herbal MAOI), and eat it slowly too.  Then I\u0092ll inject synthetic DMT intramuscularly, thereby avoiding the inconsistencies of DMT digestion. There\u0092s no fucking that up.\r\n\n\n\nT+0:00 \r\n\nAfter swallowing 3g of ground syrian rue, I begin the marathon pill eating session of 30g of dried green T. Peruvianus flesh, ~60 pills over and hour and a half.  I have done more than this before and it worked out fine.  I begin to feel the mescaline about an hour after swallowing the first cap of the ground up flesh.  A half-hour after this\u0097trying desperately to ignore the feeling by watching a Mr. Show DVD\u0097I am undeniably nauseous. So much so that exhaling at any speed beyond cautiously slow causes my stomach to rhythmically spasm. \r\n\n\n\nThankfully I had thought ahead and was keeping a plastic bag by my side, because there was no way I would\u0092ve made it to the toilet in that condition\u0085\r\n\n\n\nT+2:00\r\n\nThe result of all that work, nausea, and vomit is a mescaline buzz that I know doesn\u0092t have nearly the vital power to provide the DMT with the necessary escape velocity to guide me to that skyward realm of endlessly accelerating beauty that the combo\u0092s parabolic trajectory rocketed me through before.  It isn\u0092t a bad buzz, perhaps a low ++, but it isn\u0092t enough. \r\n\n\n\n I decide to inject (IM) 3mg of 2C-E\u0097enough to prop up the mescaline launch pad without necessitating redesign to accommodate its own specs, I think.  And I\u0092m right.  Within an hour I am at a solid ++, a warm and sensuous phenethylamine enclosure whose predominantly emotional architecture is, as predicted, mostly mescaline-inspired. \r\n\n\n\nT+3:00\r\n\nI dissolve 10mg of 4-AcO-DMT in juice and drink it down. I\u0092m hoping to mimic a long lasting mimohuasca* \r\n\n\n\nT+4:00\r\n\nWithin an hour of imbibing the 4-AcO-DMT, the tripartite combo is humming along nicely, though strangely still lacking in intensity. Despite taking the 4-AcO-DMT on top of syrian rue it did not feel like the addition of a mimohuasca high to the established trip, but rather the combinatory effects of it with the other two chemicals created a kind of sweet n\u0092 mild psychedelic euphoria, entirely pleasant in one respect but falling far short of the presumptive synergistic potential of all these psychedelic Titans in another\u0085 vexing respect. \r\n\n\n\nDuring this hour I spend my time priming my mind for the DMT dose with images of roses.  Their aesthetic is one of fantastically lush and vibrant bounty.  There is a mathematical elegance inherent to the most healthful forms of the species that engages both the cerebral side and the artistic heart.  It was that mixture of precision and fecundity that embodied that last trip\u0097a deific scream of evermore quickly unfurling reams of eidetic art, projected directly into my mind from the luminous visions of mad seraphic geniuses. The rose, I deem, is my hopeful vision incarnate.  Now I\u0092m ready for the \r\n\n\n\nDMT. **\r\n\n\n\nI knew from a past experience that 50mg of DMT intramuscularly injected would come on almost fully within 6 minutes and by itself produce a +++ level of intensity.  Though I had combined mimohuasca with small doses of every psychedelic involved in this trip to good effect in the past, I had never used this specific combo before, nor had I ever used DMT intramuscularly with a MAOI.  I therefore decide to start with 25mg.  \r\n\n\n\nT+5:00\r\n\nI do so.  I listen to a couple of songs containing especially high levels of harmony and markedly florid compositions to further tune my mind to the desired frequencies.  When they\u0092re finished eight minutes have passed.  Past experiences tell me I should be peaking yet the trip is only lightly colored by DMT at this point and there are no indications that the intensity is increasing.  \r\n\n\n\nT+5:09\r\n\nI inject the remaining 25mg.  Within three minutes the DMT increases in intensity six-fold. I\u0092m here\u0097this place, that before the great experience this one hoped to model was my conception of heaven: a heterodox hell of endlessly accelerating beauty and creative substance so great and unrelenting I cannot will myself from it, and thus can never escape it, but in whose fugacious beholding is inspired a tremulous, soul-buckling gratitude and staggering awe. For about a minute and a half my DMT addition is a success.  I am precisely where I want to be. \r\n\n\n\nI open my eyes but I can hardly see a thing.  Hot, histemic tears bathe my face as I fumble manically with my headphones. ***  Now I want desperately to be lying down and listening to music.  I need a rhythm.  I finally hit play\u0097I don\u0092t even know what I will be listening to\u0097and don my tear-speckled headphones before collapsing prostrate onto my mattress. As soon as I lay back a slippery gulp of hot, watery mucus slides down my throat, the flow of mucus from here on is constant.  \r\n\n\n\nT+5:11\r\n\nMy throat is suddenly parched, doubtless a symptom of the massive water draw this pseudo-allergic reaction is causing. If there\u0092s a cup of water nearby I\u0092ll never find it in this condition.  I must make it to the bathroom sink.  I sit up in bed and stare through cascading tears into the torrent of visuals before me.  But this lachrymose sight is also a feeling: one of having gone too far.\r\n\n\n\nI am strongly disoriented and my head feels hot.  I am the heat ripples radiating from the forehead that houses the febrile dream of a blessedly-mad mental patient.  Major ego-tectonic activity being registered here\u0085 shit. My psycho-strata are shifting like alternating layers of clear hot oil and ice, creating isolated bubbles of immiscible thoughts and sensations, though all transparent to each other and growing evermore fluid. \r\n\n\n\nOn my way to the bathroom I need to defend myself from an ambush by my treacherous walls and open closet doors.  Fuckers come at me the three-hundred-and-sixty-first degree of lateral planer rotation, which I didn\u0092t expect.  Making my defense is quite an ordeal because my hands are still four feet behind me. But I finally pull through and make it to the bathroom.   \r\n\n\n\nWith what will be my last fully successful effort at purposeful movement for over an hour, I fill a cup with water at the bathroom sink and hastily gulp it down.  I allow my shaking legs to buckle and I drop to the floor. Soon my proprioception is shred to ribbons and thrown to a riot of winds where it thrashes about violently in twisted currents.  I can feel pressures and textures but cannot discern where they are in relation to any part of my body, so I must deduce the positions of my limbs from the pressures and textures they encounter and cross-reference that with my memory of the layout and material composition of my bathroom fixtures, I remain, surprisingly, detached and rational. \r\n\n\n\nMy limbs are so weak. A kind of strange mixture of numbness and exhaustion seems to permeate their muscles. I am about to find this feeling is a result of neither of these descriptors, but rather that my limbs\u0092 loyalty to me is surreptitiously being relinquished to some mysterious, imperious menace.  \r\n\n\n\nSuddenly\u0097teeth gritted and fists balled\u0097I am wrenched into the fetal position by a spastic reflex. This is accompanied by a viciously energetic surge of profound disorientation and nausea.  My face is soaked in tears and spattered by constant trickles and bursts of mucus from my nose and mouth.  My hair and body become soaked with sweat alarmingly fast.  \r\n\n\n\nI will not lie in my own vomit too. \r\n\n\n\n I feel out the toilet, as opening my eyes to find it is futile, and just barely raise my head over the bowl.  I look down at the water, which appears to be directly below me, but the proprioceptive impression I receive from my hands is that I am actually too far away to make it into the bowl.  My trembling arms are about to give out, and so I must hook my chin on the rim for support before I can vomit, trusting from the pressure on my neck that I am indeed over the bowl. \r\n\n\n\nThe sensation of vomiting is horrendous and unrelenting.  I think the retching has been stretched to its most miserable limits, and then, in a feat of gastrointestinal contortionism, curling like the fetid petal-edges of a rotten flower, my esophageal sphincter suddenly feels as though it blows inside out.  It comes with a wet pop and a grotesque, synaesthetic vision that\u0092s rancid to the core, infected by bilious colors and violently visceral dynamism. \r\n\n\n\nAfter approximately a minute of this convulsive, un-breathing hell I fall back to the floor and drop my head onto a slippery dollop of snot I had ejected earlier and gasp for air, my lungs slurping in fluid from my throat and reflexively sputtering out coughs in rapid-fire succession.  This is could be bad. **** I know from previous experiences that, when it\u0092s used intramuscularly, the peak of DMT only lasts 15 minutes before a noticeable decline, and I\u0092m about due to start noticing that decline.  But it doesn\u0092t come. \r\n\n\n\nAnother surge throttles me and I fold inward, clenching my gut while digging my nails into my palms. Jesus, what\u0092s happening to me?  Now my right shoulder is irresistibly being brought to the side of my head, and my left arm has been stretched at full extension towards my hip, all against my will!  I\u0092ve experience quite elaborate, drug-mediated, extra-volitional body contortions or \u0093idiomotor effects\u0094 in the past on 4-AcO-DMT and 2C-E\u0097these effects have accompanied most of the most rapturous of my psychedelic experiences\u0097but there they were ordered, purposeful, ecstatic, and ultimately resistible (resistible in such a way as one can resist a yawn).  This experience though is of being maliciously tied in knots to satisfy a sadistic puppeteer that his power has been indelibly demonstrated.  Attempts to move outside his dictates are met with increased limb numbness, disorientation, and nausea.   \r\n\n\n\nThe surges are an ear popping, ego-concussing kind of electrochemical ramp up that turns every nerve terminal molten before finally subsiding and leaving me frozen in a state of wide-eyed shock.  They\u0092re mostly physical, at least insofar as my emotional and cerebral reaction to them remains sober, and so during all this, despite their overwhelming power, my thoughts stay coherent.  \r\n\n\n\nI snap up a quick, deep breath\u0097the air is saturated with the acid-stink of vomit\u0097and begin to hum.  I hold and repeat the tone that reverberates most strongly in my chest plate.  Towards the end of my breath I aspirate \u0093shhh\u0094 in a progressively thinning staccato rhythm, over my tongue-tip and through my teeth, like a Diamondback\u0092s fast-diminishing rattle.  I need the steady vibration and distinct tactile sensations of this exercise to coil and compose myself around. I need something constant.  This instinctual mantra will be with me often throughout the remainder of the experience. \r\n\n\n\nI need to vomit again.  This time it\u0092s worse.  ~30 seconds of convulsions are followed by another 30 of coughing on the floor after I choke on fluid again.  I haven\u0092t taken a breath. My eyes are closed yet even the darkness seems to go in and out of focus.   I\u0092m losing grip on even the most basic concept of symmetry.  My mantra is silent.  If I pass out now after all this exertion, continue convulsing and breath in vomit or significantly more fluid, I could really be in trouble.   Worst of all this is a concern that I know from these atypical circumstances isn\u0092t something that I can tell myself that, upon later sober reflection, I will see as just panic stricken and irrational, this isn\u0092t just a threat to my future mental stability, but to my immediate being and mere existence. ***** Then, at the crumbling edge of consciousness, another surge hits, but it\u0092s accompanied this time by a fiercely mortal fear that savagely tears me from the rapidly sealing envelope of unconsciousness.  \r\n\n\n\nWith frantic grasps I claw my way over the edge of oblivion and tumble into the field of brittle ontic shards that comprise the world.  I\u0092m breathing. I regain my mantra.  But now the fear lurks between breaths.  I consider shoving my fingers down my throat to purge the remaining liquid in my stomach so it can\u0092t choke me if I pass out, but I don\u0092t.  This is now a trial.  It is important that I face it as such.  \r\n\n\n\nUpon this determined thought my body twists me over onto my stomach.  My face is being forced into the floor.  My teeth saw across the tile in a serrated rhythm that reverberates deep into my jaw.  My arms and legs are being irresistibly stretched to their full vertical extensions.  \r\n\n\n\n\u0093What the fuck is this!\u0094 I demand to know out loud in a tone that quavers between indignation and a whimper.    \r\n\n\n\n\u0093Stop!\u0094 \r\n\n\n\nMy right hand is driven into the outer edge of the bath and cannot extend any farther.  At this limitation my wrist cramps painfully and I\u0092m flooded with images of deformed growth.  The visions impart that what is happening is a kind of egoic metamorphosis inextricably bound up with the movements of my body, such that each movement is a direct and integral manifestation of the metamorphic process.  Staunching the flow of these movements now will cause an aberration in the assemblage of what will be my reformed ego.  I give myself a burn on my bathroom carpet and scrape my ankle on the unfinished bottom of the sink cabinet while moving my legs out of the door\u0097the door that has to be there somewhere\u0097so that they can be fully extended, but I do it.  I have to do it.   \r\n\n\n\nThis drug can\u0092t possibly last any longer, though I suspect I\u0092m already far past the point when past experiences tell me I should be down (and I\u0092m right, this is different).  But another surge is nevertheless working its way up. \r\n\n\n\nThis time the convulsions are harder and last even longer. When I can open my mouth to breath I immediately gag on the acrid air and expend all received relief.  I crumple from the toilet to the ground, vomiting swallowed mucus on the floor next to me.  I\u0092m being held underwater.  My vision begins to blur again.  This is happening NOW. Questioning, analysis, any distancing from its demands is wholly impossible. There is nothing else in my mind. I am in my most desperate, most silent moment\u0085 \r\n\n\n\nWill I call out to my mother, make a plea to a past love, burn my last breath screaming for help to any nearby neighbors? Will this hour of desperation culminate in a moment of revelation when an anthropomorphized interventionist god, at my tortured supplication, bestows His mercy and delivers me from this demonic tryptamine\u0092s possession?  \r\n\n\n\nFor reasons I don\u0092t fully understand, and at first to my own self-estrangement, but then with briefly stuttering, lonely-but-resolute allegiance, I choose the forms of the sublime\u0097their being, their memory, and their mere potential to exist, as abstract and impersonal as that sounds\u0097as the hope of my deliverance.   \r\n\n\n\nSoon it is evident that I\u0092ve made the right choice.  \r\n\n\n\nThe pounding waves of distortion and caustic washes of physical misery begin slowly drawing into a whirling form.  At the moment it is just a glint, the liminal-edge of some terrible resplendence descried through the haze of perceptual bombardment and wavering consciousness, but the rose, apotheosized, is its manifest form.  \r\n\n\n\nThose earlier images, that precious 90 seconds, I can feel their phenomenal echo casting out from my memory.  I can trace it back to its inviolate source within me. \r\n\n\n\nI begin to do just this, and in doing so I come full circle to the rose:  an exquisite crucible where these ragged tendrils of my psyche can be poured and alloyed, recast with grafts from its supple textures, and re-braided in the whirling wake of its spiraling convolutions.  \r\n\n\n\nFor a moment I revel in absolution, but am soon disturbed by a strange force hurdling up from below me.\r\n\n\n\nI am struck with great urgency that this, this immanent fusion of psychology and form, this ego-entrainment with the sublime, is far too important to be met passively.  With pain and bitter effort, working against the spastic compulsions of the DMT, I roll flat onto my back. Shakily I bend my arms at right angles to the floor, ball my fists, and focus on these feelings of balance and symmetry I\u0092ve so difficultly wrought.  It is painful but it is good.  It is the feeling of interjecting marshaled will into a wild, vicious conflict, of forming the beginnings of a promising trialogue with my seditious body and the scattered ranks of my subconscious mind.   The resulting mixture of beauty and pain, reined by deft volition, evokes sensuously symbolic images of silk spooling around broken glass, and shapes into mind graceful forms hewn of battered iron. \r\n\n\n\nI reflect on why I choose sublimity as my salvation over a personal god or interpersonal love.  It might have something to do with a recent re-scan of Kant\u0092s Critique of Judgment, where he speaks of the sublime as free and transcendent, but I think it has much more to do with self-determination. Because it does not matter to me that Kant\u0092s theories have since fallen into some disrepute.  What matters to me is that what is most important to me, revealed by mortal fear as honest and at the core of my being, is a self-formed ideal, one that I choose to believe\u0097its ontological status being secondary\u0097to be free and transcendent, to be unassailable, to be non-contingent.  And most crucially, most centrally, that I have it in my ability to choose such an aspect of myself consciously and with a total permeation of my being. It is evidence against self-doubt, evidence that these thoughts to me are ultimately not mere self-delusions and rationalizations that hide the fearful truth that environmental machinations and my own self-interested power schemes subconsciously and fully define me (thoughts that other powerful but less weighty psychedelic experiences have taunted me with in the past).  It confirms that my spiritual proclamations, when their content is made phenomenologically transparent, are not devotionally reducible to lip service, but are inextricable from what I am.\r\n\n\n\nMy recent experiences in coming to understand an active, intelligent, and quasi-autonomous subconscious aspect of myself through psychedelics also makes me wonder to what degree this aspect might be implicated in this experience.  The way this experience has unfolded is a little too tight\u0097and punctuated by too many strange and idiosyncratic happenings, things seem, in ways, plotted to fall together.   I think not that this is mere grasping for sense in the wake of a senseless trauma, but that perhaps I was never in real danger and the central proceedings of the trip unfolded as they did though a purposeful subconscious mediation.  \r\n\n\n\nIt\u0092s as though that subconscious self, with understanding, has seized this opportunity to temper my conscious mind in mortal fear, and through this fundamental life experience it brings to full awareness a deeper order within myself, and thus expands the scope of my self-awareness. It\u0092s happened to erase self-doubt and to bring my conscious self more fully in league with my deepest passions.  This process serves to bring about a self-determined spiritual evolution, an evolution effectively expedited through the unique properties of psychedelic drugs.  If this sort of radically accelerated, subconsciously mediated spiritual evolution really occurs, it just has.\r\n\n\n\nBy the end of these reflections the DMT has faded in intensity enough for me to walk.  Visuals are still swirling around my alarm clock as I verify that it has been over one-and-a-half hours since I injected the DMT (it didn\u0092t just seem longer).  When I drink ayahuasca\u0097as opposed to dehydrating and encapsulating it\u0097the trip will usually last about 50 minutes, so for intramuscularly injected DMT to last this long, with or without an MAOI, is exceptional. It\u0092s another half hour before the DMT fades into relative insignificance, bringing the total time of its influence to over two hours.  The trip from the other drugs has been extremely blunted by its comparative timidity to the DMT and by my own exhaustion. Moreover I am simply reluctant to endure them.  I go into a dreamless sleep, and when I wake up a couple of hours later I feel only a slight afterglow. \r\n\n\n\nThough I am excited by the potential implications of this experience my life has not greatly changed. I am grateful for the long-needed humbling, but long ago I reached the essential limits of what the perspectives afforded to me by psychedelics could do to correct my overt flaws and improve my life \u0093out in the world\u0094.  The majority of my best experiences with them have nevertheless, and counter intuitively, occurred after this realization.  The value of these latter trips is only made apparent to me deep in thought, and in certain charged moments that vibrate with impossible vigor and affirmation, quiet quakes whose bottomless faults I know now to open through my core.  These most elevated moments require no justification, they are free and transcendent, and I choose them.\r\n\n\n\n* The problem with intramuscular DMT is that it\u0092s so damned short, for me it will last only 40 minutes start to finish, or so I figure from past experiences absent syrian rue that is. In the experience I was modeling this one after I had used a boiled-down-to-powder-and-encapsulated mimosa extract.  The result was two and a half hours of DMT powered bliss. I wanted to emulate that.  A past experience with syrian rue and 4-AcO-DMT had been remarkably similar to the effects of the just mentioned mimohuasca form (which for me is slower and smoother in effect than its liquid form), and so that is why I used it here.\r\n\n\n\n**I am fully aware of the perceived futility (a justified perception) of trying to recreate a ++++ experience by deferring to exacting mimetic practices, nevertheless, three of my six ++++ experiences in a decade of psychedelics use have occurred in the past 10 months, and this recent \u0093rapture-proneness\u0094 makes the idea that the state can be significantly affected in me through these means seem more probable.\r\n\n\n\n***That this is a histamine reaction is unknown, but I simply don\u0092t know what else would mediate a reaction like this.\r\n\n\n\n****Even despite the numerous psychedelic elements in play during the trip I believe the overwhelming reaction I had was due almost entirely to the syrian rue and intramuscularly injected DMT.  The only drug in the mix I have not combined mimohuasca with is 4-AcO-DMT, though I have used it with mushrooms, which are of course closely related chemically.  \r\n\n\n\nIn fact I\u0092ve even combined mimohuasca (at a +++ level, the same level 50mg DMT (IM) without an MAOI takes me to) with Peruvian Torch and 2C-E in the past, as well as these latter two with 4-AcO-DMT, all without troubles, giving me confidence it the relative safety of their combination here.  More strange still is the delayed reaction of the DMT.  I had used 50mg doses of DMT (IM) alone twice prior to this excursion and both times I was peaked in a lucid and manageable trip in less than 6 minutes, and completely down by the 40-minute mark.  Yet at 8 minutes into this trip I barely even felt the first 25-milligram make-sure-the-MAOI-doesn\u0092t-intensify-it-that-much dose.  \r\n\n\n\nAlso, my impression was that MAO levels in the blood were not so concentrated that their inhibition would cause a profound increase in the intensity and duration of an IM dose, my hardly affected experiences with IM DPT\u0097which is quite susceptible to an MAOI orally\u0097in conjunction with syrian rue certainly support this impression. It\u0092s abundantly clear now that even though I think I know my body\u0092s reactions to drugs based on numerous past experiences, and that there is reason to believe most all of the drugs involved, at the small dosages taken are fairly safe, when dealing with powerful psychedelics no amount of precaution and past experience can truly guarantee safe passage.\r\n\n\n\n*****I\u0092m fairly certain that the DMT isn\u0092t doing any metabolic damage here directly, but I never expected and never read of such violent or bizarre physical symptoms.  Death or lasting harm affected by lack of oxygen from choking while unconscious (or from some fatal idiosyncratic or unforeseen contraindicative reaction) didn\u0092t, and doesn\u0092t seem out of the question under these conditions."

        "report_text": "About two months ago I obtained two grams of DMT. I was elated, after several years of searching for it. I had really wanted it in the first place but had settled for various other dialkyl tryptamines over the past 3 years which had brought me a wealth of interesting and amazing experiences. I tried a couple of moderately succesful yage journeys which had shown me the potentials of the mindspaces available through DMT. But I have been perhaps a little cowardly about inflicting the physical effects of Yage on myself again, though I longed to visit the mental territory again.\r\n\n\n\nThe package arrived one sunny April morning when I had a day off. I loaded a joint with a small dose of the white freebase powder and sparked it. An immediate warm buzzing around my neck and shoulders followed the bite of the harsh smoke on my lungs, and my vision gently morphed with fine horizontal seams like a venetian blind, each band tinting reality either red green or blue in alternating order. Intuitively I felt a sense of potential power, and significance although as the experience quickly dissipated I was strongly aware of the taste of plastic and protests of my long suffering lungs.\r\n\n\n\nFive minutes or so afterwards an old friend from whom I had not heard for years phoned out of the blue to say they were moving abroad. I had heard talk about synchronicities on chatboards etc before but I tend to the skeptic side on such matters. In my thoughts about why I have an interest in the matter of psychedelics, I take the view that you have to seperate clearly in your mind the normal workaday life of a 21st century westerner, and the dreamworld that psychedelics can reveal. I don't believe in ghosts and ufo's etc during normal life. I remain a little wary of those believers with a glint in their eye who abandon their lives completely to the pursuit of one conspiracy or another. But when I am under the influence of psychedelic drug, at a sufficient dose, the dream state I occupy appears to have certain rules and parameters which are different to those of the lucid state. Whether or not the word 'real' can be used in reference to a state where these different parameters apply is a moot point. When I am in such a state I may as well interact with it, if only in the interest of knowledge or novelty.\r\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon I bought a glass pipe with a little side hole and some vials from the local head shop. With this new equipment I determined to explore further. I put some dry tobacco in the body of the pipe along with some spice and held it over a candle to heat the pipe. I made several attempts like this with varying successes. I often complicated the lift off by worrying about the safety of the candle flame. I found music distracting. A singer's voice would be morphed into a metalic jabbering. \r\n\n\n\nThese first journeys were brief and hard to integrate. The rapidity of the visions was such that only the general tenor of the content was discernable. It seemed to have a sinister tone, consisting of images such as playing cards flashing by, skulls, military hardware, screws. At one point a vicious gun turret on the back of a plane with jutting machine barrels. Just a quick image frame amongst many. The almost instant passing of this phase was followed by a warm womb-like phase where I did not have any technicolour realist visions, just the warm reds of the bright ceiling light through my closed eyelids, across which seam-like waves folded and divided. I had experienced an almost identical state as this latter phase using 4 AcO-DMT and felt very comfortable. In this subjective state I often feel like I am in the presence of a benevolent God, to whom I feel it is only right to thank for all the good things in life, and to send out good wishes to all my loved ones. I then feel a little guilty and send out good wishes to all the people I don't love. Finally I feel very virtuous all round. \r\n\n\n\nWhen back in the sober state my skeptic brain has a good laugh at these religious epiphanies. This is what I like about psychedelics. They let me experiment with possibilities which in the real world are not possibilities. For example the question 'What might it be like to burst a sack full of dimensions on your head?' is a subject of metaphysical speculation. But under the influence, and you might be lucky enough to participate in some kind of encounter where this actually appears to take place.\r\n\n\n\nI often found myself swaying gently with my arms folded and a warm smile over my face. Almost bowing to the universe in satisfied bliss. I took one hit in the kitchen at the back of my house overlooking our back garden which has many pleasant trees, some still in blossom. The good sunshine that evening gave the foliage a translucent light. In the kitchen I heated the pipe over the gas hob. The disadvantage of my method seemed to be that it led to quite some wastage. I needed to cover the side hole on the pipe to achieve a stronger negative pressure which results in a more effective vapourisation. However the pipe was hot to touch and so again I was approaching the jump with a cluttered mindstate. I managed two tokes, holding the last in, but not convinced of its adequacy. I kept my eyes open holding steady on the kitchen units while seated on a tall stool. The surge began and I watched the kitchen units dancing before my eyes, sliding along left to right in outline form, neon coloured reds blues and greens. I looked at the cooker whose control surface would duplicate along all the units flickering back and forth. Then I looked at the microwave on the work surface, who/which was also indulging in these strange diplays. \r\n\n\n\nImmediately I beheld the sudden exchange of pulses or spurts of neon energy between it and the gascooker. At this point I had to laugh a little. I had a sense that this performance was for my benefit somehow. There had been some comedic element which had struck a chord in me and just seemed absolutely hilarious. I remember thinking that if my Mrs had walked in I would have pointed at what I was witnessing and said 'would you look at that. . .' quite unselfconsciously as though it was there to see plain as daylight.\r\n\n\n\nI began to surmise that my technique was probably flawed and wasteful. The pipe became quite grubby. I didn't want to wash away remnants of the previous burn, but I knew that the remnants would quickly degrade anyway exposed to air. I was getting toward the end of my spice as well, so I made further dispatches to Arrakis, to whom the people of which culture I am eternally indebted. In the knowledge of almost certain replenishment, I decided to purchase a more effective pipe and make the best of what was left to me at that time. I found a light bulb style vapouriser which matched the prescription perfectly at a penny under a \u00a35 from the headshop. Its ease of use has led me to imagine using it to try vapourising some other tryptmines (all in salt form unf.) such as 4-AcO DMT and DPT.\r\n\n\n\nThis vapouriser I tested in the kitchen over a hob. I was a little apprehensive because I had been chewing over the sinister tone some of the visions I had experienced. I wondered if that was the thin end of the wedge and that by getting a really big chestfull I was only going to submerge deeper into something sinister that I did not want to see. I could not reconcile this fear with the wonderfull blissful sense of being I was experiencing in the afterglow. I wondered if it was some part of myself that I was genuinely scared to look at. The voice of logic reminded me that whatever happens is over almost as quickly as it begins, and that gave me a sense of strength going in.\r\n\n\n\nThe heat melted the light yellow tinted crystals into a colourless pool which gathered in the bottom of the bulb. I watched white vapour uncoiling around the glass as the bulb became opaque. I drew slowly one long potent lungful and as I did so the vapour billowed more furiously. My tongue and lips numbed and my respiratory plumbing stung a little as I filled up. Eyes opened I placed the still billowing bulb down on a cold hob and turned the heat off. As I did this the room tinted yellow sepia, and I shut my eyes looking for a slide show. I was immediately disappointed. Just the womblike state with some extra patterning, but then the warm crescendo of buzzing both audible and physical spread through my neck and shoulders, followed by a very slight crack or snap from somewhere in my auditory canal. \r\n\n\n\nFor a short while I was not strictly local. I dont remember events as such, just a sensation of being somewhere in between my kitchen and the dreamworld. Then this absence of self was burst by a small patch of vivid vision. Like the view through a tiny hole in the wall of a darkened room out on to the scene on a bright summer day. I thought I saw a snippet of rows of parked cars, like the US guzzlers of the 50s with their chromed wings, or maybe it was an orderly residential scene. I gasped involuntarily, startled by the many implications of this vision. The stylistic appearance of the scenes were partly culturally familiar, and at the same time slightly skewed. I was startled out of phase with the vision, but I was exhilarated and back in the afterglow where I began giving praise to the universe for what I could only formulate as the privelege of what I had seen. \r\n\n\n\nThe question of intentionality came up again in my mind. It felt like I had been shown these things by the big whatever. I gently swayed on the stool and basked in the beautiful concept that the universe was far more bizarre and comedic than I could ever have imagined. I had gasped at the ontological ramification that I might have seen another world or a parallel universe. I felt certain for a few moments inside that I had seen proof that worlds and culture not particularly unlike our own, or sharing certain evolutionary or environmental parameter existed, and there might even be many of them. This was not the kind of revelation that transposes well into conversation so I kept my council to myself. My Mrs does not approve of my little hobby very much, but for all the right reasons, because she cares about me, so I don't recite her my adventures.\r\n\n\n\nThe general effect of all this DMT smoking has been strangely positive. I am conscious of the power of suggestion in potentially shaping the experiences we have. After all I think it was Hume who surmised that we are the sum of our experiences. I felt almost virtuous not to have witnessed entities which could be described as self transforming machine elves, though that is not to say I was in any position to doubt the subjective truth of these descriptions. But I had felt what seemed to me divine pressence, and visualised abstract entities in the wide mind space of closed eyes with a strong light source. And I had witnessed something that had startled me to the core of me being in a deeply satisfying way, although I could not fathom its significance. It could have been many possible or impossible things and called to mind a reality along the lines of Michael Moorcock's Multiverse.\r\n\n\n\nI also noticed a sense of well being in general life, which I have heard reported, and subsequently may be a result of preconditioning. However this sense seems so tangible and yet natural as to be too good to be true. I found a part of me thinking that everyone should have a blast with this stuff at least once. A clich\u00e9, I know. I also imagined the possibility of a worldwide pyramid selling scheme by which an alien race might prepare humanity for contact. This tickled me, since in my newfound openess to the parameters of altered space, such a conspiracy might be impossible to disprove. I felt heightened empathy with even the people I perhaps disliked, and tangible antidepressant effect. Not that I am generally depressive these days. But there is something to this. \r\n\n\n\nI would only complain that my chest has been taking a beating. There is a strange logic that it appears that the more effective a hit I achieve, the less troublesome my chest is. I cough up some chunks in the aftermath, and the taste doesn't offend me anymore.\r\n\n\n\nMy next consignment arrived a week after that final excursion. Excitement boiling over, I prepared myself for more adventures. I was faced with a dilemma. The experience, I felt honestly in my heart, was 'A Good Thing' as far as I could see. It seemed to open my mind on a spiritual level which chimed morally with the parts of my Anglican upbringing which I still respect, and the Buddhist ideas I had been reading about recently. It gave me exhilarating journeys and imaginings which I somehow wished I could record or describe, and would be grist to any mind with a soft spot for science fiction. I also sensed somehow the experiences constituted a revealing or an uncovering, due to the perception of continuity between trips. Something might be captured in my memory in one experience and in the next one I might seek to hone in on that image and it might blossom itself into many possibilities. It was an ongoing discourse between me and the drug. \r\n\n\n\nHowever, it is expensive to obtain and woefully illegal. I can't see how it can be legal like tobacco or beer. It's just too powerful. I was pretty scared by what seemed hellish imagery in the early part of my experiences, and it almost seemed to be warning me off. I don't like to break the law. I only do so in relation to weed and my 'research'. I don't speed and I am at peace with myself most of the time morally. I had been reading about Alan Watts, a religious academic and Buddhist who at one point said 'when you have got the message, hang up the phone' in relation to psychedelics. I agreed with those words but certain that I had not yet got the message. I certainly wanted to see more.\r\n\n\n\nWith this in mind I decided to explore the current two gram I had and order five which I would package and freeze with the other samples for some distant future time when I felt the urge. I had a hunch that this might be just short window of availability, and that the privelege of this opportunity might soon be gone.\r\n\n\n\nI had bought a gas turbo lighter to provide a safe but effective heat source. If for whatever reason you let go of it, it goes out, so that the possibility of dying from burns just as you are on the brink of universal knowledge is avoided. Furthermore it starts the vaporisation very quickly and you can reduce the heat (if your throat is hurting) by increasing the flame distance.\r\n\n\n\nI got comfy on a very soft chair in my converted garage. I had strong spotlights on the ceiling pointed to my head. These help embolden the colours of the closed eye visuals giving garish hues to the visual field. I loaded a 100mg hit and started the flame, beginning to inhale slowly once the vapours rose. I must have managed a long, cool, slow breathful because I was able to calmly hold it in for what seemed like a very long time. I was able to dispose of the bulb and lighter in a civilised fashion and close my eyes expectantly. My self was dissolved again after a short cavalcade of pageantry and carnival, of which I was no longer fearful. But I was again non local, or in dimensional interstices.\r\n\n\n\nTo the right of my mind space was a blue mass. A large entity formed of layers of strata, and bejewelled with many crystals along geometric fault lines which folded, twisted and morphed its form in a mechanical fashion, was alongside of me. The blue colour was around the entity, (like an amniotic sack). I moved my mind towards it and I burst into the sack which fell away enough for the entity and myself to make some kind of contact. It was a light green to yellow colour underneath the sack. (Suspension of disbelief obligatory at this point) I sensed a blue sheen spreading over my own body which was rigid but gently juddering with a fine tremor similar to which I have experienced with DPT. I also became aware that I was pulsing and stretching thythmically besides the fine tremor, matching the oscillations of the entity to my right. When I did so in phase with it, the spaces between the strata of its twisting form widened, and the jewels inside showed even more vivid crystal surfaces. It was through these surfaces I again glimpsed the strange world which I had seen that previous time. The more my body matched the entity's dance the greater one of these crystal windows became, filling my minds eye and almost breaking through into the scene beheld. \r\n\n\n\nA sunny 1950s suburban street, somewhere far across the universe. This phase of physical movement and intense vision was accompanied by a strange sensation of flashes of sudden coldness, which intuition told me was something to do with interacting with the entity. Although I did not fear for my life or any extreme drama, it was enough to distract me and the consciousness of my visitor(s) diminished. I was still in the far off state and spent some minutes swaying and basking in the moments of grace. My eyes remained closed however, though I occasionally flashed a look at the room around which neon sparks flitted.\r\n\n\n\nTo integrate this experience, I resolved to wrap up warm for my next attempt, and to follow the dance of the entity if I dared. I had begun to entertain the possibility that the entity might in fact be using my curiousity to lure me into contact. There might be no doorways into other universes, just beings using extensive kitsch simulations of such worlds to lure psychonauts for their own mysterious ends. This might explain the slightly skewed stylistic tone of the visions. I also had to acknowledge there was an almost sexual angle to these encounters, a feature I had noted on several occasions when I had used 'heroic doses' of 4 AcO DMT. I also became aware about how much dancing and physical conditions play a part in the shamanic phenomenon.\r\n\nUsing what I had learned I was able to reproduce a very similar experience. The dance lasted perhaps longer, and I persevered the cold spells, so that I got a clearer view into the crystal that I locked onto. I noticed that all the other crystals feature a simillar scene, which might have been slightly different, like cinema film stock, I couldn't tell, since I could only look closely through one crystal at a time. \r\n\n\n\nThe entity itself is hard to describe in great detail. It had something akin to an Inca or Aztec architectural influence, combined with the opulence of a wedding cake, except that it could rotate, twist and shuffle like a rubic cube. In this latter trip, I noticed a neon green amniotic sack along with the original blue one I was familiar with. I did not have a chance during the time available to explore the possibilities with that entity though I sensed it was of a species with the first. As I returned to consensus reality I sent my now habitual prayers out and wished all souls well. I decided to hang up the phone for a while, until I had been able to record and describe some of what I had been able to experience. There was still much I wanted to try. I had still not gone for the infamous 'third toke'. I had grudgingly come to understand the term 'self transforming machine elves' with greater intimacy. I have been amazed by how this drug is so specific and unspecific at the same time. And how difficult the game of memory can be, when the recollection of what occurred evaporates like a dream at wakening.\r\n\n\n\nBecause of the similarity I have noticed between the post breakthrough phase of DMT and my experience of a good dose of 4AcO-DMT, I am speculating about using the AcO ester as a springboard into the DMT space. I have not got round to this yet, nor a journey which I am postulating using 5g 10:1 White Caapi extract I have, to permit oral ingestion. At the moment, I am happy to vapourise due to the compact timescale. I am not considering the nasal route or plugging since I have the freebase and both routes are reputedly unpleasant, although I am not too squeamish generally.\r\n\n\n\nThis stuff is both humbling and exalting. It shows me how little I really know about the universe and realty, but gives a sense of joy at the small part I play in it. And it seems to do this with its tongue in its cheek, for which it seems a reassuring and hopefull thing to my mind.\r\n\nAll the best - peace and love - PiPPUK"

        "report_text": "This is a rather long account of two extremely potent experiences with two forms of DMT, followed by an account of the same experience by another participant/witness.  \r\n\n\n\n--\r\n\nPharmahuasca was what they were calling it.  Two 75 mg. harmaline tablets (MAO inhibitor) with four 10mg 5-MeO-DMT chasers totalling 40mg.  What the hell, I thought; I'm in the jungles of Mexico (in Palenque), I'm surrounded by experienced psychonauts (at a ethnobotanical conference), what's the worse that can happen?\r\n\n\n\n'Be prepared to die,' our source told me, grimly earnest.\r\n\n\n\nYeah, I thought, like a major mushroom trip, right?  I felt I was ready.\r\n\n\n\nNot quite.\r\n\n\n\nIn all, there were nine of us forming a circle in one of our rooms, with mattresses and pillows laid out for all of us.  My brother sat across from me.  Two of the nine were experienced with ayahuasca and become our leaders.  Before consumption, each one of us stated our intent, out loud or to ourselves.  Mine was 'to experience spiritual consciousness.'  Rather vague, this being my first time with this class of substance.  Unsure of how long to wait between harmaline and 5-MeO, we decided 20 minutes should be plenty.  (Later we were told the quantities were designed for simultaneous consumption of the both the harmaline and 5-MeO tablets.)  Some of us took the entire dose, some took half.  I was 24, 5'10', 115 lbs, and decided to take the entire dose, being my first and perhaps only opportunity.  'When in doubt, double the dose,' to quote Terrence McKenna; a well-loved, experienced shroomer.  (Oops.)\r\n\n\n\nThe effects of the harmaline were subtle, energizing, like a betelnut buzz.  20 minutes later, I ingested all four 5-MeO DMT tablets.\r\n\n\n\nWhat follows is both from memory and the account of others.\r\n\n\n\nIt came in waves.  Strong, soporific, deep, intoxicating waves, building in intensity, like watching storm waves build up on shore.  Stronger, stronger, stronger.  Some of us started chanting, singing.  Some softly moaned with pleasure or insight.  I felt queasy, nervous, not quite nauseous at this point.  I remained silent, focusing on my breathing to calm myself.  I started trembling, cold, gradually warming up, feeling her, the spirit of ayahuasca, calling, wanting to take me.  I felt myself slowly giving in, retreating, giving in, unsure of where I was headed.  What have I got myself into?, I asked myself.  This was not what I expected at all, this was much much much deeper and unlike anything I'd ever experienced (x, mushies, lsd, thc).  This was only the beginning, I was soon to learn; the experience had not really started fully yet.\r\n\n\n\nI laid down on my pillows, and draped my arm over my eyes to block out the candle light.  (It was around 11pm when we started).  I remained focused on my breathing, staring into the black of my arm, feeling my brain, my mind sink into a warm absolute void outside of my body.  I was so focused on my breathing I didn't notice the void at first, and when I did I sat up with a start, then slowly settled back down, trying to ease myself into it.  \r\n\n\n\nThe first waves of nauseousness started to creep up on me, and I increased my breathing rate, deeper, harder, almost to the point of hyperventilation, until the experience had drawn me even further in.  I started to sink, sink, sink through my body through the ground, my body going limp, numb.  My breathing was still strong, hard, almost frantic, obvious to everyone around me.  I was losing my connection with my body, and it was impossible to tell if I was breathing enough or too much.  My thinking mind, my inner voice began to fade, I couldn't concentrate on words but rather only abstractions of very deep, complex ideas.  I just knew things without thinking them.  Like ideas were being fed directly to me.  From me?\r\n\n\n\nMy breathing rate increased, approaching hyperventilation without my realizing it at first.  One of the leaders crept up to me silently, with auga florida (rose water), which he sprayed across my chest and face from his mouth.  I started to snap back, and became aware of my breathing, but seemed unable to control it.  He laid his chest on mine, 'Follow my breathing,' he said and forced my chest to breathe with his.  I relaxed, slowed my breathing, became more aware of my surroundings, pulled back from the black.  He retreated back to his mat, and rather quickly, I fell right back into the inky black void, like a deep dreamless waking sleep, drifting, swimming, sinking.  I drifted for what felt like an eternity, my mind disassociating, deeper, deeper, the deepest of dreamless sleeps....  It lasted for an eternity, me swimming in and out of it, vaguely aware, numb, drugged... \r\n\n\n\n...and then I woke.  I sat up, and everyone around my was laying down, quiet, still, seemingly asleep.  Some stirred or twitched, like coming down from x or shrooms while trying to sleep.  It was over.  It felt like 4-6 hours had passed, and I felt extremely rested, aware, awake.  It appeared lighter out, dawn was approaching it seemed.  There was a slight crackling of energy around me, visual hallucinations of colored points of light in a static textile/grid-like pattern, similar but different from shrooms.  I looked at my watch.\r\n\n\n\nOnly 15 minutes had passed.\r\n\n\n\nUh oh, I thought.  That was just the beginning, the first wave.  I wasn't sure quite what to do.  Lay down, walk around, what.  I stood up, and nervous anxiety started to creep up on me.  I pushed it away, annoyed at my seeming inability to get into it, relax, let it take me.  Open eye visuals seemed stronger, but still vague.  When I closed my eyes, there was nothing but inky black.  I felt a dozen contradictions all at once.  I felt like I needed to take a leak.  Now I didn't.  Now I did.  I went to the bathroom, sat down, relaxed my bladder and stared through the wall... and started to be taken away, being pulled, fast and hard and strong... I resisted, pulled back.  I didn't need to pee after all it seemed.  I stood up, a little dizzy, started back to my pillows.  My brother turned the corner, checking up on me.  Hi, he said, how you doing?  He seemed almost alien, I almost didn't recognize him, and yet he was the most familiar thing in the world at the same time.  Good, I responded.  Holding my arms tight against me, cold again, nervous.  Impulsively, I hugged him, tight, almost clinging.  I didn't realized how scared I was until then.  Wow, I said.\r\n\n\n\nI made it back to my pillows, laid down.\r\n\n\n\nShe took me fast, much stronger, much harder than the initial wave.  The first wave was nothing.  I lost all awareness of my body, my surroundings, everything around me.  I felt myself fall right through the earth, like a neutrino, like the earth was nothing but empty space.  I left my body completely and dissolved into the universe.  My mind became placed into the mind of the universe, expanded into it, knowing everything to be known, but completely unable to think in thoughts, words, my mind-voice was completely gone, yet I was completely aware of ideas knowledge, wisdom, abstractions which were so perfectly clear and understandable to me outside of any known constructs of language, way beyond language, completely nonlinear thought and yet not-thought.  Just knowing.  Pure knowing.  My mind, my consciousness, my poor little brain struggled to keep up with it, struggled to keep up with everything streaming in, struggled to fit the mind of the universe within in.  She spoke to me, tried to calm me, tried to explain.\r\n\n\n\nYou're dying, she said.  You're dying.  Isn't it beautiful?\r\n\n\n\nAnd I was.  I felt myself, my mind, me, turn inside out, again and again; it came in waves, slow imploding inward waves which twisted and folded me inside out again and again, and each time was a death, a shocking, terrifying, incredibly beautiful, intense, joyful, incredibly profound death.  I died over and over and over, hundreds of times that night, all while she tried to coax me, show me, teach me, love me.  I felt like Arjuna in the Baghavad Gita, when Krishna reveals himself in his full glory, only the brilliance was all in thought; there were no visuals, just pure inky black emptiness, void.  Something in me wouldn't break, though, something in me held back, even still, after all those deaths; it wasn't just fear, it was love, I wouldn't give her my heart, my emotion, my pain, my core.  She gently pulled and tugged, let go, she said, just let go.\r\n\n\n\nI started to feel my connection to my body again, faintly, as if through a dark shrouded distant unreal dream, completely alien to me; my body started flexing back, my breathing built in intensity from very slow and very deep to hard, intense, forceful breaths, approaching hyperventilation, seemingly beyond my recognition to control rather than my ability.  My body was alien. The physical realm was alien.  I couldn't cope with it.  I opened my eyes, I sat up sharply, I gasped.  Everything seemed alien, but not because I didn't recognize things or people; it was as if I were seeing everything for what it _really_ was rather than how I perceived things as a human with human senses.  Everything spoke to me on a different level.  I started to panic, the physical realm was alien, my mind was alien, there was nothing of comfort, nothing I recognized as real and true as I'd always known them.  I jumped up and accidently stepped on someone's foot.  Empathy washed over me in waves, and I couldn't stop apologizing.  The owner of the foot, took one look at me and gave me a hug, asked if I needed anything.  Speech, words, ideas, I grasped for that part of my mind, struggled to communicate, fell into her eyes, her soul, saw her very inner being, felt her love and compassion wash over me.\r\n\n\n\nI don't know, I whimpered.  I don't know.  I don't know.\r\n\n\n\nDo you want to go outside?\r\n\n\n\nI don't know.  I looked at the door.  Outside.  It seemed so vast, so open, the jungle out the back porch.  I could feel the cooler air streaming in.  Yes, I said.  I stumbled outside, to my shock.  The plants, the trees, they were so ALIVE!  They were so alien.  I could feel them, I knew them, they were alive, feeling, sentient beings, completely alien to anything I'd ever experienced, even shrooms.  I recognized them as plants, I recognized their shapes, but everything else was alien.  Their personalities spoke to me, comforted me in eery knowing silence, identified with me, felt sorry for me.  My brother came and stood next to me, trying to evaluate my state.  You ok?\r\n\n\n\nAgain I struggled for words, I tried to evaluate my emotions, to little avail.  I don't know, I whimpered, I don't kow.  Do you feel sick, he asked?  The mere suggestion washed waves of nauseousness over me.  Yes, I said.  Do you want to throw up?  Yes.  I thought it would make me feel better.  Purge myself.  Start the cycle down.  I tried throwing up.  It didn't work.  Put your finger down your throat, my brother softly suggested.  I put what felt like my whole hand down my throat and wretched, over the railing, into the forest.  My body felt better at first and then WHOOSH!!!\r\n\n\n\nThe strongest wave yet washed over me, pulled me in, captured me.  I was in Purgatory, stuck between the physical and mental realm, not comfortable in either, afraid of both.  Please, I whimpered.  Please, please, please, please.  By this time everyone started gathering around me.  I looked into each one of them, supplicating with a Please.  At first whimpering and then stronger and stronger, more and more forced.  PLEASE.  PLEASE.  They formed a tight circle around me, hugging me in turn, trying to figure out what I needed, how to help me.  Please what, dear?  Please what?  The question perplexed me.  I didn't know.  Just Please.  Please.  The waves washed over me, my body went limp after each passing one, and after each one I would stand rigid and force a PLEASE.  More and more insistent.  My awareness of the physical realm starts to fade from here, but I remember yelling PLEASE at the top of my lungs and then supplicating and then whimpering.  'How can I live knowing what I know?!'  'How can I live feeling what I've felt?!'  'How can I live seeing what I've seen?'  'How can I live?!'  'How can I LIVE?!'  I don't remember saying all of this, it was related back to me afterwards.  I felt like I was pulsing, throbbing, glowing with energy.  My gaze stared through each person with fierce intensity, I looked through each person.  Only a few held my intense gaze looking through them, literally feeling my ability to pull them into me, into the intensity of my experience.  Some started pulling away as I pulled them into me, I could feel their anxiety as they realized, FELT what I was going through, where I was.  Do you want to lay down, they asked me?  They motioned to my pillows.  I look at my pillows uncertainly.  It seemed comforting.  I started to relax and let them start to lay me down.  Another imploding wave of death washed over me as I let myself relax and sink into it.  NO! PLEASE! I snapped to back to rigid attention, exhausted with the extreme physical and mental exertion it required for me to maintain a connection to the physical realm.  I started clinging to some of them, wrapping my entire body, arms, legs around them.  Especially the rose-water leader.  He seemed to be the only one to know how to respond, strong enough mentally to contain me.  He forced me to stand on my own, forced my arms at my sides.  I threw some scornful Pleases in his direction, but he didn't flinch.  My body would go completely limp in waves pulling me back in and he shouted at me, NO!  He forced me to remain standing.  He became stern but warm, full of love and compassion.  The others backed off, only catching me if I started to fall.  It was just me and him in a stand off.  Please.  PLEASE I directed at him.  A wave would wash over me and I would start to fall, then jump, stamp, force myself to attention, hold my chin up proudly when I was able to stave them off.  PLEASE, I directed at him again, proudly.  He comforted me:  This is You, he said, touching my chest.  Feel the Power.  This is You.  I would start to go limp.  NO!  This is You.  This is You.  Feel your Power.  Feel your Power.  I stamped the ground again with my feet, looked up, I was mentally exhausted, absolutely exhausted, barely clinging on.  I've seen you before, he said.  I know, I thought, in my state.  I know you all.  I am you all.  I know you, he said.  I've seen you before.  The others started murmering in agreement from behind me.  You look Christ-like, he said.  I accepted it without question, it was obvious to me in my state.  I was Christ.  I was God.  The energy, the confidence, the power, the love in me began to surge, I felt it expand around me, encompassing everyone.  It became very quiet, very still, just me standing there, breathing, pulsing, glowing.  I let my guard down, I relaxed my shoulders, my body slightly.  I was regaining control.  I was becoming me again.  I breathed the biggest deepest most comforting breath of my life.  Thank You, I said to my leader.  Thank You.  I turned to each one.  Thank You.\r\n\n\n\nNo, THANK YOU, the leader said to me, as I noticed each of them also start to come down, relax, breathe.  'The power of ayahuasca was definitely with you tonight, my friend,' he said, relieved to have me back.  For those moments, they had become me.  They were me.  I had them trapped in my attention, in my mind, every one of them a vivid picture in my mind, and I could feel myself letting them go, one by one.  I hugged them all.  Two or three hours had passed. \r\n\n\n\nThey walked me outside to the front this time, and under the moon under the stars was a megalithic rock garden, the igneous rocks seemingly perfectly arranged in perfect harmony to each other, pulsing with energy, alive, knowing, watching, greeting me.  I walked around them in circles, slow, slow circles.  Greeting each one, blessing each one as I passed by.  Everything I saw, I blessed internally or with a Thank You.  I blessed the moon, the stars, the planet, the air, the rocks, each person, myself, my surroundings, the night.  A few stayed with me, watched me quietly, followed me, caught in my spell.  I would inscribe circles around them each in turn as I circled around the rock garden.  Circles, circles, circles, first one way, then the other.  I felt so calm, so peaceful, so beautiful, so ALIVE.  I sucked the life-energy of the air into me, I could feel my blood capture it, I could feel it course through my body, I could feel it be released, I could feel the energy flowing through me, I could hear the energy flowing through me.  I basked in my own internal fire, remembering all my college science, religion, philosphy lessons, knowing them, realizing them, feeling it all happen, feeling it all make so much beautiful sense and harmony.\r\n\n\n\nThere seemed to be rising commotion coming from inside.  Eventually, slowly, I made my way back in.  One of the other participants got stuck, but a different place than me.  He became extremely violent, yelling and whimpering, 'I don't understand.'  Over and over.  He was a friend who had just helped talk me down just minutes earlier.  He was lashing out at things, people, clinging, digging into their flesh.  I tried to talk him down, to let him recognize me, I let my mind enter that space, his space, ever so carefully.  It worked for a little while, until he clung to me with such tenacity he began to hurt me, dig into my flesh, pull out clumps of my long hair.  They helped pull him from me.  He broke one person's glasses and bit another's thumb fairly severely to the bone.  We weren't able to control him, he was lost.  We brought him back home to his room 1/2k away, to let him come down in peace and comfort.  He remembers nothing of the violence, his 'down' personality being completely unviolent and unantagonistic.  The transformation was amazing.\r\n\n\n\nThe other leader who had a gift for reading into people told me afterwards that he saw my heart swollen, huge, like it was ready to burst.  He asked me to think about anything in my life that I needed to let go of or deal with.  I was actually in the extremely intense, painful, and drawn-out process of breaking up with my girlfriend of several years.  For the other guy, he said he saw a large insect-like being clinging to his head, holding on, talking to him.  The leader talked with the insect to find out what he wanted.  The insect said he was telling him what he needed to know.  The leader told the insect to leave because we couldn't control him.  The insect left and our friend became even more frenzied, so he called the insect back to calm him down, which eventually happened.\r\n\n\n\nThe evening broke up with a rather weird energy after that.   A lingering indescribable chemical-like taste or smell stuck with me for several hours afterwards as well as a kind of glowing Tao-like pattern before my eyes, very indistinct.  I made it back to me room, where I slept well that night.\r\n\n\n\nAll in all, I consider the experience a positive and necessary one, which taught me what to expect from this class of substances, and how to better prepare for any future consumption, including dosage.  I am still processing this experience, many months later, as little by little, my mind lets me remember more of it (curiously, the distinct chemical flavor returns with the memories).  Immediately afterwards and for several weeks, my mind wouldn't let me think about it, a strange and unique phenomenon for me.  It was a full-blown psychological near-death experience, and that's how my mind remembers it--with trepidation.  I am curious to repeat the experience in due time, knowing what I know now.  It was the definitely the most profound experience of my life.\r\n\n\n\nThe next evening, I got back on the horse and smoked some crystalline nn-DMT for the first time.  I'd heard 5-MeO DMT referred to as the Power and nn-DMT as the Glory.  That is exactly how my experiences fit with these two.  My intent with this experience was to understand my experience of the night before.  There was a group of 6 of us plus the supplier with the pipe.  We were in one of our rooms, on the beds.  I was the second to last to try it; all of the others had experiences lasting 10-15 minutes max.  I inhaled three or four strong puffs, laid back, and fell through the bed.  It came on very fast, very strong, and extremely visual, the most visual of anything I've done, eyes open or shut, and completely unlike 5-MeO which was barely visual, and strangely, only with open eyes.  It was out of body, my body felt disconnected, as the night before, somewhat tingly this time, like when a limb falls asleep.  Direction, orientation, gravity, etc became meaningless in this completely abstract work of visual art.\r\n\n\n\nI found myself lying down in a room, surrounded by alien 'presences' standing all around me in my peripheral vision.  The presences appeared to me as alternating black and white outlines and I could only see their heads peering down at me.  They were featureless except for color and shape; a black head shape, next to a white head shape, next to a black head shape, 6-10 of them, very interested in me but trying to stay out of my field of vision.  In retrospect I felt like I was lying on hospital bed as a patient of these presences.  Straight in front of me or above me in the distance was a rectangular box, slowly approaching.  It was my reaction to the box the presences were most interested in.  As I studied the box I started to make out details.  I was looking into the open side of the box and along the top edge were about a dozen or more dancing snakes, weaving rythmically back and forth, like sea grass rippling under the sea, and pulsing in rainbow psychedelic colors, mostly reds.  It was absolutely hypnotic to watch as they slowly approached with the open box below them.  Slowly, my attention moved from the snakes to the contents of the box.  On the left was a circular disk, quartered, with a black dot in each quarter, also pulsing and with rainbow colors.  On the right was a round flask with a long neck, and I quickly realized this was the most important of the objects being revealed to me.  As I drew my attention to it, it slowly came towards me, open end into my mouth.  I could feel the flask on my lips, in the physical realm, which surprised me, and suddenly and involuntarily, I began to swallow, again and again, drinking what felt like pure energy.  As I began drinking from the flask, my field of vision was drawn into the contents of the flask.  I zoomed in, closer and closer until I realized with a start that I was drinking DNA; I could make out the strands and then the double helixes and then as a single strand loomed to fill my vision, it began to unwind, and I followed the strand _simultaneously_ in both directions at once, forward and backward in time, a strange but pleasant sensation.  What followed was an incredible experience; I felt myself morphing into various species, all feeling very familiar.  It was not so much visual as it was what it actually felt like to be in the mind and body of first a fish, then a frog, then a snake, an eagle, a lion...I was experiencing the unfolding of life itself, and realizing, as I had realized the night before and on other trips and meditations, that the story of life is not one of simple chance and contingency influenced so much by natural selection, as we observe in the greater physical realm, but rather it is directed by a simple life force of pure energy which operates on the smallest of conscious, sentient levels, down to the very molecules, atoms, even quarks and smaller where matter and energy blend and are really one and the same.  All of it is conscious, the entire universe is conscious and connected, at every level and every size, and we are nothing more than manifestations, physical packages, containers of that pre-existing everlasting all-pervading consciousness.  DNA strands are nothing more than books, physical mnuemonics, stable energy forms of ideas and patterns, that worked and are written, saved and read back by this all-pervading life-force.  Working patterns of DNA are not simply selected by pure chance, as classic evolutionary theory would have us believe, it is being written and directed by something much greater, much more pervasive, and much more subtle than we've ever till now supposed, and this all-pervasive awareness is finally being realized in the West through quantum mechanics, evolutionary theory, mythology, psychology, synchronicity, and most especially, psychonautics.\r\n\n\n\nBut I digress.  Slowly, my field of view returned back from the contents of the flask back out to the snakes, approaching ever closer, until I realized they weren't just snakes but sharp scythes, lashing out at me, cutting at my chest, my heart, dancing ever so rythmically, gently but necessarily, telling me to let go, open my heart, let go, let myself feel.  I opened my eyes.  The room was nothing but paisley patterns and paisley people.  My body was somewhat tense.  I closed my eyes again.  The snakes were gone, I couldn't see the presences, but I knew they were still there, watching me, protecting me.  In the distance a different presence began to approach: a large red demon-like creature with a knobby bulbuous head and bulging arms and fierce but nonhostile eyes.  His right arm and hand was outstreched, reaching for my head.  He gently reached through my flesh, my skull, and gently palmed my mind, like a blanket wrapped around my brain.  Then he faded into dozens of eyes, peering, turning, twisting, watching, which in part slowly faded into darkness.  I opened my eyes and met the gaze of everyone else's eyes in the room.  The feeling of the demon's palm and the presence of the protective entities didn't fade--they were meant to stay with me and they have, even now.  30-40 minutes had passed, the longest that evening by far.  I told my story quietly and slowly got up.  I felt much relieved from my previous night's experience; the Glory of DMT was ever so gentle, tender, compared to the Power of 5-MeO DMT.  After the experience, incidently, I ended up having to piss again and again that night, although I had not drank more liquids than usual, other than the contents of the flask in the vision.  Weird.\r\n\n\n\nSeveral weeks later, still processing these two DMT experiences, I had one of the most realistic, vivid dreams I have ever had in my life.  Christian Ratsch once described these types of dreams as Kali Dreams, after the Hindu goddess of mayhem and destruction.\r\n\n\n\nIn my dream, I was a child again back in middle school, talking to a beautiful young girl, who, in retropect, looked like Parvati, who is the loving, gentle alter-ego of Kali.  Her gaze and awareness were piercing, focused, all-seeing, all-knowing and her eyes looked straight into me and gave me a queasy, nervous, glowy feeling, like intense love at first sight.  The class bell rang, and she started for the classroom along with all my classmates, who were taking their seats.  I had to go the bathroom, though, and I knew the teacher wouldn't mind me being a little late (it was my favorite Spanish teacher, incidently).  Returning from the bathroom, I walked into an empty classroom.  The back door was open, though, and sun and breeze were streaming in.  It was eerily quiet.  I stepped out the back door to find the bodies of my classmates strewn all over the lawn, bloody, dead.  Only a couple were still alive, catatonic, carefully loading the bodies into a sport-utility.  I stood there in shock, watching the scene, trying to figure out what had happened, when I realized I was being watched.  It was her, the beautiful girl, Parvati/Kali.  She looked at me with the slightest of smiles, wide eyes, arms and palms turned out towards me, presenting the entire scene to me.  With that gaze, I instantly realized she had done this, she did it as a lesson for me, she was trying to show me how beautiful death can be, she killed these children to teach me and to teach them the beauty and value of both life and death.  She freed them, she let them go, she returned them to the eternal all-pervasive universal consciousness.  It was a gift, her gift, her eternal timeless lesson to us, to not hold on so tightly to such a precious gift as life and overlook the precious gift that is death.  With this realization and her gentle loving gaze, I was overcome with an overwhelming sense of peace, beauty, joy, despite my natural instincts of terror and revolt.  The scene and the lesson before me was absolutely sacred and necessary.  Kali had visited me.  I opened my eyes and found myself wide awake in bed remembering clearly every vivid detail.\r\n\n\n\n---\r\n\n\n\nThe following account was provided by another of the participants in the room with me on the first night and offers an alternative (and more sane) perspective on the events that occured that evening.  My thanks to the participant for providing me with this wherever you are...\r\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmahuasca night\r\n\n\n\nI was one of the 9 people in the group that night and I took only a 20 mg. dose. Here is my own version of the story: \r\n\n\n\n'And so that brings us to one of the two major tales of la semana de los entheogenicos. That being 'La Noche de la Pharmahuasca'. I had met a young couple earlier in the week, 'J', a hispanic engineer from MIT, and 'R', his Korean girlfriend. They had been rambling on during dinner #2 about the drug that they prized above all others, just going on and on and on about the incredible effects of this stuff which was incredibly hard to find, called twoseebee. So I listened politely for about 10 minutes of this, then took the canister out of my pocket and said in a very low, very calm voice, 'How would you like to try some of your favorite drug?' Well, the details of the rest of that night are somewhat hazy, but somehow we became very good friends in a big hurry, and they pretty much adopted me for the rest of the conference. And on the next to last night they dragged me off to a Pharmahuasca session, just when I had resolved to go drug-free that night to prepare my poor overworked serotonin receptors for the last-night blowout.\r\n\n\n\nFirst, some background. Pharmahuasca, as you of course know, is any combination of an extracted MAO inhibitor, usually harmaline derived from Syrian Rue (Peganum harmala), along with a tryptamine such as DMT or psilocybin. As it turns out, J. Ott is preparing to market in Europe the following components in separate packages: 1. pills containing 75 mg. of harmaline labeled as 'herbal energizer', and 2. pills containing 10 mg. of 5-MeO- DMT and labeled as an 'herbal tonic'. The point being that they will be sold separately, so that only those in the know, so to speak, will be aware that they must take 2 of pill #1, and then 4 of Pill #2 in order to achieve orbital velocity. What a brilliant, devious, twisted mind that the Ott-man possesses! \r\n\n\n\nSo it was that I found myself in bungalow #3 with eight other souls that night at ten o'clock. The session was to be 'run' by two would-be curanderos, Steve and Stevie, the first a social worker/social activist, the latter a sometime rock musician/sometime acid casualty. Their credentials were genuine experience of several Amazonian ayahuasca sessions, and a collection of shamanic power objects and doodads that were supposed to ward off evil karma. The other participants: the aforementioned J. and R.; plus T., a British pagan Earth Mother who hugged everyone and everything at the slightest provocation; M., a skinny long haired sensitive New Age Guy; D., who looked and acted like a hippie pirate; and B., a Swiss burgher type who turned out to be the rock solid anchor that held the night together when everyone else fell apart. \r\n\n\n\nThe ground was prepared for the sowing. The beds were taken apart and the mattresses placed on the floor, along with rugs and sheets to cushion all against the hard and hurtful places. Lights were turned out, and candles and incense lit. Steve and Steve brought out a sack of wondrous things; crystals, metal turnings, sculptures, dried herbs, mandalas, and an exquisite tiny monkey skull that caught my fancy later. The sacrament was passed out, and the chanting and the icaros began........\r\n\n\n\nThen it was that my scientist persona emerged. There was a side debate over whether the harmala pills should be taken some minutes before the trypt, or simultaneously. Instructions were that all should be taken together, but I, the great western scientist, knew that the harmaline had to go in first and knock off the enzyme, so that none of the 5MeO would be chewed up. But it turned out to be a bad idea to mix Western Medicine and primitive shamanism. So some ended up dropping all at once, and others a half hour later. This broke up the feeling of unity among the participants, and also resulted in some getting a larger effective dose. As it turned out these were also the people with the lower body weights, resulting in an range of doses from cowardly (I took 20 mg) up to foolhardy (40 mg in the case of M., who looked to weigh about 100 pounds). \r\n\n\n\nSo anyway, the deed was done, and we all were dosed, and Steve and Steve and J. had some real pretty songs and chants going when the base of my spine started to vibrate. 5MeO doesn't favor you with fancy color patterns or carrier waves, or elves dancing on your chakras. It is pure power intruding on your core. It is a push, a shove, an acceleration, a rocket exhaust, a steadily rising voltage, like being at the base of the Grand Coulee Dam as an earthquake shatters the concrete wall and lets 50,000,000 gallons of water follow the force of gravity towards your body and sweep you off into the great beyond, and you don't have any idea where it will tail off and allow you to breathe again. Higher and higher and higher and yet again higher and just as it starts to get unbearable, the peak is reached, and I settle down into the roller coaster and realize I will live. And I also realize that some of those around me have taken more than twice my dosage, and are still rising up into realms inconceivable. At this point all in the room are silent, recumbent on their mattresses and blankets, and pillows, splayed out desperate to hang on to shards of reality. And then the groans and the moans begin. Those who took the higher dose are now trying to deal with extreme nausea and cramps. Steve, the primo curandero, is hit the hardest, and begins to retch and puke into a plastic bag, transparent so all can see the full drama of La Purga cleansing his soul. Two others lurch onto the back deck, to heave over the log railing into the back yard and then stagger back. Others, such as J. and R. just twist and writhe in agony, but keep their stomach contents down as if such were a badge of honor in the midst of the battlefield. And on my right, M. the skeleton man, begins to contract his limbs like a pretzel, and hyperventilate, and emit tiny cries of horror, which slowly accellerate, and become more and more complex as he starts to coil like a steel spring, and mutter, and ullulate, and then ZING, he is up and headed for the back deck screaming 'Please, please, please!!!'.\r\n\n\n\nWell, at this point, only two of us were ambulatory and able to follow in pursuit, both having done 20 mg doses. Yours truly and B. each got on either side of the fellow and held him up against the railing, until Curandero Steve came along to guide the flight. By now M. was into a major death trip, and his screams had resolved into a loud 'Pleeezzze, let me live....' repeated slowly over and over. Steve had to talk him back into his body, using alternating love and logic in the best intrepid traveler fashion. And slowly everyone else drifted out on the deck in various conditions and levels of unreality. We made a ragged circle of seriously twisted souls, group hugging and singing and soothing the lost one back into a semblance of humanity. One by one people would break away from the circle and go heave whatever fluids were left inside over the rail, until it resembled the gutter outside a Roman orgy. After about an hour of this, M. had returned to a merely transcendental state, and we all went inside happy in order to compare notes. People were making up icaros, and drumming on whatever was handy, and the good feelings returned for quite awhile. I got into examining the power objects now strewn around the room along with melted candle wax, half-full barf bags, blankets, pillows, shoes, flotsam and jetsam strewn around as if the Berserkers had marched through. J. remarked to me that the experience wasn't as strong as he hoped for and he was a bit disappointed, despite having taken 40 mg. N. said that he was almost straight.\r\n\n\n\nAnd then, there seemed to come a second wave of drug action. Everyone who had previously had severe nausea doubled over again and started groaning. My own stomach started to complain at this point and I almost lost it as the room started to breath in and out. There was a general migration back to the deck, where J. and R. got into a hammock strung up between two poles, desperately trying to get comfortable. I missed what happened next, as there was a lot going on in my head and stomach. But it soon became apparent that we had another freakout. \r\n\n\n\nIt seems that J. somehow slowly regressed into an animal state, becoming hostile and assaultive towards any and all that were out on the deck with him. Girlfriend R., apparently having seen this trip before, fled to the safety of the bungalow bathroom. Meanwhile, B. and N. were sort of restraining J., who was screaming out curses and general abuse to any who came near, while kicking and clawing anyone within reach. And the look on his face was one of absolute savage hatred. With four large men pretty much restraining him, I left the scene to check on M., who was starting to fray at the edges again, and R. who was in the bathroom sobbing away. Just then it all broke loose on the deck in back, and I heard several people shout in succession, followed by a crash as a body smashed heavily into the rear window. Somehow, the window did not break, but the shouts resumed, and M., totally totally freaked, ran past me out the front door and off into the general population, as it were. I followed him, and soon gently led him back into the madhouse when the loud noises stopped. Well, what had transpired was that J. had bitten B. severely on the hand, drawing a fair amount of blood, and in the confusion, had broken away and run off at full speed into the window. He probably couldn't even see at that point. Well, he was shortly subdued, and placed on his back with four people gently restraining him from gouging their eyes out. Bad karma circulating in that brain of his, he soon attained a childlike state in which he replied to anything that was said with 'I don't want to...' in a petulant tone. Brave psychonaut reduced to a three-year old, the rest of the session was taken up with surrounding this infantile creature with kindness and trying to establish human contact, while the whole time he used any free limbs to try and inflict damage on anyone and anything within reach. Brave B. even tho wounded, turned out to have the great deal of strength needed to keep this animal contained, while all around people continued to take breaks to dry heave or administer each other hugs and support for their own still fractured and tormented psyches. \r\n\n\n\nWell, it was a wonder that during all this, no other people came to investigate what in the name of Moloch was going on (granted that the bungalow was on the edge of the compound). Several people told me the next day that they heard the screams, but I guess it wasn't that rare over the course of the week, and who wants to step into that degree of weirdness? So at that time, now 3:30 in the morning, everyone was whipped and at least starting to come down, and the Steves were obviously beginning to regret the whole endeavor, so the closing ceremonies were kind of forgotten and the game became 'how do we get rid of this guy, J.'? J. and R. lived up on the hill in my sector, so the whole party ventured out of the bungalow en masse escorting the crazy guy, with me lighting the way with my trusty flashlight. And one by one, without any farewell, people silently started to peel off and slink away to the shelter of their own cozy safe havens. Until it was only girlfriend R. and myself carrying the supplies, while poor B. pretty much wrestled Mad J. up the hill under the glare of the full moon. He was actually starting to recover his senses at that point, and went more or less under his own power, while still emitting an unbroken string of curses. So we reached the dwelling place of J. and R. finally, and the unhappy couple was deposited in their bed, with B. playing chaperone for however long it took to be confident that J. was not capable of murder. I took myself off to my own bed at that point, and slept right through breakfast the next morning, but emerged in time to hear Sasha's chemistry tour de force. And later had a pleasant conversation over lunch with a very flustered and repentant J., who was blessed with a greatly enhanced respect for psychoactives and a whole lot of stuff to work through over the course of the next few months.'"

        "report_text": "Separating from my Flesh Carriage \n\n\n\nBackground Information \n\n\n\nIn the realm of substance experimentation I consider myself something of a seasoned veteran.  I have extensive experience with stimulants, dissociatives, opioids, opiates, benzodiazepines, tryptamines, and phenethylamines.  Many of my experiences involve research chemicals and unique combinations of substances.  I particularly enjoy the exploration of combining multiple substances to see what synergistic or conflicting effects result. I particularly enjoy the exploration of combining multiple substances to see what synergistic or conflicting effects result.  I think cocktails of chemicals can often yield the most rewarding experiences when crafted with care and intent. \r\n\n\n\nI take 5000 IU of vitamin D3 daily along with 2400 mg of mesalamine for a lifelong stomach condition. I do not consider either of these to be a contributor factor in this experience.  \r\n\n\n\nAll of the dosages in this report were prepared on a freshly calibrated .000 mg scale.  The materials were sourced from a vetted chemist and tested using several reagents.  I am confident the substances were indeed racemic ketamine and DMT and that their purity was true.\r\n\n\n\nI chose to use racemic ketamine, rather than esketamine, because I was hoping to maximize the sedative effects I find racemic provides me.  Esketamine can be a bit more sparkly and zippy at times.  For me, esketamine is more similar to DMT (and most tryptamines in general) than racemic ketamine.  I wanted to pull myself in a different direction to produce a slightly wider array of sensations.\r\n\n\n\nThe entirety of the experience in the report below was spent in the company of two close friends, Iroh and Bodhi, as well as my trusty dog Gee.  We spent the evening in my home with comfortable lighting and soothing incense.  We covered the floor of the living room in pillows and blankets to maximize our comfort.  The set and setting were absolutely prime for an intense experience; I had responsible and  able experienced sitters, in a controlled and optimized space.\r\n\n\n\nA combination of personally written notes, audio recordings, and notes from Iroh and Bodhi were used in the creation of this report. I am confident that the timestamps are accurate to within +- 5 seconds.  Given the short duration (relative to other substances and experiences) of the peak of this experience, I employed extra care to include seconds in some of my timestamps in order to provide readers with as much data as possible.\r\n\n\n\nI have tried this combination several time before but never in such a controlled environment or with the intent of writing a full report.  I have found DMT glass vape setups (such as a The Machine) awkward to handle when intoxicated on ketamine.  Changa has been by far my most memorable way to experience the combination of DMT and ketamine.  My past dozen or more DMT experiences have been using a digital volcano vaporizer.   I use this in the experience described below as well and found it very manageable and effective.  I did retrofit the Volcano with an oversized bag to minimize the number of \u0093bag refills\u0094 required.  The Volcano was set at 426 Fahrenheit degrees.\r\n\n\n\nTolerance was a complete non factor on the day of the experience.\r\n\n\n\n \n\nT + 00:00 [6:38 PM]\r\n\nI generally like to dip my toe in the water before I continue with medium or high dosages of ketamine.  I find this allows me to mentally adjust and become comfortable with the movement into a different mental space.  Correspondingly, I begin the evening with the preparation and insufflation of 35 mg of racemic ketamine.  There is almost no sting in my nostril but as I begin to prepare my DMT dosage a tangy chemical flavor makes its way to my palate via the slow but steady drip that has developed after a few minutes.\r\n\n\n\nI have prepped the \u0093material chamber\u0094 of the Volcano with a new metal pad.  On this surface I deposit a freshly weighed 31 mg of DMT.  I have not crushed or processed the material in any way as it is relatively fine already.  Normally I aim to conserve energy whenever possible, but tonight I give myself the leniency of preheating the volcano to 426 Fahrenheit degrees and maintain this temperature.  I want the DMT dosage available whenever the time feels right.\r\n\n\n\nT + 00:16 [6:54 PM]\r\n\nI have reached a \u00b1 on the Shulgin Rating Scale.  Things seem a little surreal.  The differentiation from sober is not obvious, and yet it is: my normal thought process is simplifying and I feel a release of tension from my mind.  A slight misstep cues me into the first sign of physical inebriation.\r\n\n\n\nT + 00:21 [6:59 PM]\r\n\nThere are no significant fine motor skill issues while I weigh, crush, and insufflate 96 mg of ketamine.  This is a large step up in dosage for me: I anticipate this taking me deep into the terrain of the land of dissociation.  I won\u0092t be far from a k-hole once this kicks in.\r\n\n\n\nT + 00:36 [7:14 PM]\r\n\nThings are developing.  The drip in the back of my throat is slightly anesthetic and certainly has the familiar cool and chemically flavor of ketamine.  I flush my nostril by insufflating a small amount of water from a cupped hand underneath the kitchen faucet.  The effect of this is profound and rapid.  My head swells, then retracts: there is a moment of dizziness.  I decide to sit on the floor, amongst the pillows and blankets, in hopes of allowing a smooth entrance to the experience.\r\n\n\n\nThings are growing increasingly foreign.  I have stopped thinking about the upcoming DMT.  Even with this looming in the near future, I can\u0092t really be bothered with thoughts and concerns for the future.  I\u0092m swept up in the calming but increasingly strong mental waves of dissociation.\r\n\n\n\nT + 00:43 [7:21 PM]\r\n\nVisual static creeps in from the peripheral of my vision until it is present on everything, even objects in my direct focus. Visual static creeps in from the peripheral of my vision until it is present on everything, even objects in my direct focus.  While retrieving a glass of water I giggle at my inability to land the water from the faucet into the glass on the first try.  I don\u0092t wipe up my small spill.  Instead I mechanically walk back to Bodhi and Iroh with the giggle transforming to a grin.  The numbness in my legs makes walking feel foreign.  Although unfamiliar, I enjoy the way that I am forced to pay attention to the action of raising and lowering each leg as I walk.  I\u0092m especially aware of how my body connects to itself.  Normally I think of walking  in regards to my feet doing all the work.  Now however, strides are felt in the originating muscles: my hips, quadriceps and glutes.\r\n\n\n\nAfter reaching my destination I close my eyes as a way to check my condition.  Within a second, vivid cartoons of random animals backed by rotating geometrical patterns spring to life across my entire minds eye.  The visions come of rapidly, brightness of colors, and the calmness.  As a set, these are a sign that I am tripping heavily.  I\u0092ve done as planned; gone deep into the land of dissociation.\r\n\n\n\nThe effects continue to rise but I have the feeling that I am nearing a peak and plateau.  Nothing from my measurable senses alludes to this.  It is an instinctual notion, likely due to my familiarity with my body and how it reacts to this substance.\r\n\n\n\nT + 00:53 [7:31 PM]\r\n\nI am past a solid ++ on the Shulgin Rating Scale.  This is about the point in the experience that I anticipated introducing tryptamines to my system.  My environment is comfortable and I feel ready.  The familiar butterflies flap their wings in my stomach as I make my way to the floor in front of the couch.  I rearrange a few pillows so I can lie backwards and be supported in a relatively upright and comfortable position if necessary.  I always have nerves  when before I smoke DMT and this evening is no different.  The ketamine does not  have any suppression onsuppress these feelings.\r\n\n\n\nMy fine motor skills are notably impaired as I place the Volcano housing onto the base, without the bag attached.  I turn on the air flow and watch the machine.  I am waiting to see the first wisps of smoke emerge.  This method is intended to provide the most concentrated smoke possible by not filling the bag with forced air before the crystal material begins to vaporize.\r\n\n\n\nAfter about three seconds the slightest swirls of white smoke emerge from the base.  I immediately connect the bag and watch milky white smoke fill the plastic receptacle.  The bag crinkles loudly as I stare at it with intensity.  I am acutely aware of the severity of my next few breaths. \r\n\n\n\nT + 00:53:04 [7:31 PM]\r\n\nWith the bag at maximum capacity; the time has come.  I give myself one last deep breath then raise the bag to my mouth.  I inhale slowly and deeply.  I draw in breath until my lungs are stuffed full.  I count to ten using my fingers to help me be honest and accurate.  The smoke is arid, drying out my insides.  This aligns with the smell of the substance: pungent and singeing, reminding me of a cross between the scent of opening a new can of tennis balls and the stench of burning plastic.  I exhale without significant irritation in my throat.\r\n\n\n\nT + 00:53:14 [7:31 PM]\r\n\nI exhale the first hit.  Already I feel the my head become light and its interior begin to swell and stretch.  A gentle, low pitched, tinnitus type hum resonates through my eardrums.\r\n\n\n\nI am completely focused on the smoking process.  Suddenly the well rehearsed process of breathing in, holding the smoke, then breathing out seems complicated.  Suddenly the well rehearsed process of breathing in, holding the smoke, then breathing out seems complicated.  I forge ahead with another large inhale, this one slightly less deep than the first.\r\n\n\n\nI feel as though every cell in my body is vibrating in harmonious agreement and grand crescendo.  My body continues to sing vibrations outwards into the world.  My mind, personality, being, essence, whatever one wants to call the thing people reference as \u0093I\u0094, begins a process of simplification.  There is no feeling of movement: I am increasingly grounded and stationary with each passing second.\r\n\n\n\nT + 00:53:28 [7:31 PM]\r\n\nI exhale without checking my fingers for the ten second count.  It just seems like time to breath some air again.  After a few deep breaths, I raise the bag to my lips once again.\r\n\n\n\nAll of the colors in my vision are saturated.  Besides being more intense than usual, their intensity pulses slightly.  Where colors clash, at the edges of objects, there is a bold black line that encases a finer white line.  This accentuates everything I see and makes an environment I am very familiar with seem new and unusual.\r\n\n\n\nNormally this level of visuals, and the speed at which I am moving away from sobriety, would make me think about pausing my DMT intake.  I seem to have an easier time accepting the change in headspace while departing from a ++ condition (from the ketamine) than from a sober baseline.\r\n\n\n\nCounting is difficult.  My arms droop from my crossed legs to the floor.  I direct my gaze to my fingers to see if they can help me achieve my one through ten.  Looking down, I am shook by the lack of depth perception.  My veins are visible on the surface of my arms.  They are also on the floor?  Wait, I\u0092m confused, I can\u0092t see where my arms end and the rug begins.  I almost can\u0092t reconcile what I\u0092m seeing.  My hands, which I know to exist in the space I am looking at, are simply not registering with my mind.  There are patterns moving across everything.  My focus zooms in slightly before immediately retreating.  This all couples with the breathing, slight rising and falling, that is occurring in the \u0093rug arms\u0094 area of my vision.  The end result is me giving up on trying to count with my fingers because they don\u0092t seem to exist anywhere in my visual field.\r\n\n\n\nSuddenly things reverse; my hands and arms pop off the suddenly 2-D background.  They look like the vision tests that optometrists give using the cards and glasses to check depth perception and color blindness.  My arms stand out in a goofy, almost synthetic manner like early 3-D movies.  My skin looks sickly; blotchy, with patches of various tan colors shifting around.  My vision zooms in on them, or they breath upwards towards me, I can\u0092t tell which.  The sensation is like I am opening my eyes as wide as possible while intently focusing on my arm as I lower my head closer to my skin.  I know my head is not actually moving, the effect is only happening within my mind.\r\n\n\n\nThe whine of my tinnitus cranks higher and louder.  I have some slight trepidation about how intense this might get.  I consciously tell myself that now is the point to begin letting go and giving into the experience that I have brought upon myself.  Holding on here could cause things to go drastically awry.\r\n\n\n\nMy eyes are closed as I inhale and hold in the last of the smoke contained in the bag.  I am no longer actively counting the seconds but I am dialed into the passage of time.  I\u0092ll know when to exhale.\r\n\n\n\nT + 00:54:44 [7:32 PM]\r\n\nThe time arrives and I open my eyes as I blow outwards.  Expecting the world to be breaking apart into brightly colored fractals and patterns, I am taken aback at the relatively benign version of reality I find in front of me.\r\n\n\n\nI am beyond the physical and mental capability of re-filling the bag to see if any of my dosage remains unvaporized.  Iroh takes over the process and decides to leave me undisturbed as the re-filled bag is nearly 100% clear (meaning I received the entirety of the desired dosage).\r\n\n\n\nI don\u0092t slump back into my pillows as I expected.  The atomic vibration going on inside me slows rapidly.  I have no desire to move my gaze around the room.  This journey is for me, very internal; I forget Iroh and Bodhi are here with me.  My mind is separating from the room.  It is also branching away from its typical one-pieced existence.  I do a mental scan to check my condition.  Well, I tried to do so anyways.  About halfway through asking myself \u0093How are you doing Anatoli?  Anything to be concerned about?\u0094  The thought dissipates.  I\u0092m no longer thinking or capable of thinking in a standard manner.  I\u0092m 100% a spectator in the increasingly foreign space I exist in.\r\n\n\n\nMy mind, like my body, is eerily still; devoid of all movement.  There is none of the mental hyperspace travel that I typically associate with entry to a DMT experience.\r\n\n\n\nI had intentions to keep my eyes open as long as possible to enjoy and document the visuals brought on by the substances.   As is typical for me however, I feel most comfortable with my eyes closed as the tryptamine comes on.  My brain tingles and an infinitely complex maze of mental pathways spark to life with electrical zips, crackles, and pops.\r\n\n\n\nT + 00:55:15 [7:33 PM]\r\n\nI\u0092m no longer in the sober body or mind of Anatoli Smorin.  I\u0092m seated on my pillows, eyes open now, staring blankly into the kitchen.  Perspective, angles, size, and comprehension are distorting massively.  I am processing the objects in the room in a minimalist fashion that is absolute in its simplicity.  My thoughts flow:\r\n\n\n\nStove.  That is a stove.\r\n\nCabinet.  Those things are cabinets.\r\n\nDishwasher.  That is a dishwasher.\r\n\nStool.  That is a stool.\r\n\nWhy are the counters crooked?\r\n\nHow is the dishwasher taller than the counters that sit on top of it?\r\n\n\n\nI ponder similar questions as the items in my kitchen continues to change size.  I never see them change, there is no shrinking, growing, or breathing. The objects seem to change shape while my mind focuses on other pieces of my vision. Only when I pass visual focus over them again am I able to see that they have shrunk or grown.\r\n\n\n\nThe air is charged with a sort of electricity; my vision is crunchy and unsaturated.  The visual static begins to fizzle and crackle.  It as if the central point of my visual field is the starting point for Picasso and he has chosen to move outward from this point of origin, pushing my vision into small rectangular smudges (each roughly 2-4 inches in size).  The abstract adjustment to my visual field mimics but distorts what I know is in front of my eyes.  The oven is overtaken by silver and black squares, the floor and cabinets become brown and tan squares.  Each square has the texture of thick acrylic paint that has been moved roughly across canvas with a thick brush, distinguishable from its neighbor by the patterning that results from the direction of the brush stroke.  About half of my vision has transitioned from \u0093reality\u0094 and the objects I know are in the room, to the imprecise pointillistic square smudges.  The square shapes begin relatively abstract but they are rapidly morphing into increasingly perfect angular square shapes.  At the beginning of this visual display, it was distinctly tryptamine in nature.  As it develops, the characteristics seem to draw from the ketamine more.\r\n\n\n\nBright matte white lines, seemingly their own light source, appear out of thin air.  They begin to wrap around the outlines of the tiny squares that have blotched up my vision.  The shapes are perfectly geometrically aligned now and the white strings of light double back on themselves, creating cubes in the place of squares.  The cubes sync into formation, taking the shape of an ocean wave.  Even in my intoxicated condition I realize the true phenomenality of this \u0093visual\u0094.\r\n\n\n\nThe wave curves smoothly, a full three dimensional demonstration of oceanic shape swirling through the air in my kitchen.  After rolling forwards, reaching though the air towards me, the wave crests, breaks, and shatters into small cubes that rattle geometrically through the air.  The luminous lines collide and overlap.  Smaller cubes are created in the turmoil.  They then tumble in their own directions, spinning as they go.  As with normal waves, some parts of the spray are more turbulent than others.  These areas become brilliantly complex, infinite patterns crisscrossing in all three dimensions.\r\n\n\n\nThe crashing wave has run its course.  Some boxes disappear while others slow their tumbling and spinning but remain slowly drifting in the air.  The white lines become very bright.  I can focus on nothing but them and their compounding intensity, their glow surging stronger and stronger like a neon light on the fritz.  With a final culmination; flash!  Brilliant white light overtakes my entire visual field.  The white is brightest in the center and darkens gradually towards the edges of my vision.  The dominant white fades over a period of about a second and a half.  Although the room has not changed, in the wake of the completely unpigmented moment, it feels like I am viewing it for the first time.  It is fresh, new, and unfamiliar.\r\n\n\n\nThe entire wave visual last perhaps 4-6 seconds.  Although this is a short period of time, I was able to comprehend and retain an unbelievable amount of detail.\r\n\n\n\nSound returns to my ears slowly.  The dazzling display has been silent.  My attention has been 100% on the witnessing and interpretation of the things I have been witnessing.  A gentle murmur eases me back into awareness of a low level ringing tinnitus.\r\n\n\n\nT + 01:01:15 [7:39 PM]\r\n\nI have been entirely stoic since setting down the volcano bag.  I break the stillness with a small smile and turn of the head.  I am able to formulate thoughts now.  I begin to think of how to describe what just happened.  I don\u0092t write any notes, or speak anything to assist myself via audio recording.  Sometimes I am afraid during an experience that I will forget the details, feelings, or sensations.  In this moment however, I know there will not be a problem with recall.  This is a calming thought that allows me to not fight to stay connected to any sort of \u0093reality\u0094 or commit things to memory.\r\n\n\n\nI am still at a +++ level on the Shulgin rating scale at this point and have been for a few minutes.  The visuals are immersive and intensive enough to justify this rating.\r\n\n\n\nMy gaze stays attracted to the kitchen.  There is less shapeshifting trickery in my visual field now.  Instead there is an interaction happening between my thoughts and specific items in front of me.  I can see the entirety of the room in focus, but all my attention is centered on just two objects.  I have no choice in the matter, my focus and thoughts are drawn directly to the legs of a stool about ten feet in front of me as well as to the stove once again, which sits about twenty feet from me.\r\n\n\n\nThe choice objects shine and shimmer, almost highlighted; brighter than anything else.  Besides this glow, some relatively mellow visual static, and increased saturation the stove and stool look pretty normal.  At this point the Ketamine seems to be controlling the visuals. At this point the Ketamine seems to be controlling the visuals.  There is almost no patterning in my vision, something I typically get on any dosage of DMT.  I can, feel the presence of the DMT in my thoughts and physical brain.  A pleasant pressure works from the surface of my skull downwards into my the center of my brain.  My braincase sizzles.  This sensation is more enjoyable than similar feelings during my average DMT-only experiences (not combination experiences) due to the fact that the sizzling brain matter is steeped in the swirling sedation brought on by the ketamine.\r\n\n\n\nI have cognizant thoughts:\r\n\n\n\nWhy are these items (stool and stove) so important?\r\n\n\n\nAre they significant or just visually stimulating?\r\n\n\n\nAm I looking too far into this?  Maybe I\u0092m just high?\r\n\n\n\nThis type of basic analysis is happening in my mind.  At the same time however, I feel like it is not really \u0093me\u0094 having these thoughts because I also am dedicating 100% of my attention to soaking in what my eyes are witnessing.  Additionally, I have an internal dialogue: a running manuscript of what I will later write in my report.  On top of all these trains of thought, I am somehow comprehending the division itself of my being into multiple points of view.\r\n\n\n\nI have been existing in multiple pieces for a few minutes at least now, but I am finally realizing the reality splitting for what it truly is; multiple perspectives being perceived simultaneously in equal detail and functionality.  I feel like the sun is rising for the first time in my world . . . as though I have figured out something completely revolutionary and amazing.  The cut and dry logical thought processing from the ketamine seems to be joined flawlessly with the other-worldly, enlightened, and shimmering mental condition of the DMT.  I am holding onto the rapid thoughts much better than I would on DMT alone.  Sometimes thoughts and visions fly past in incomprehensible randomness at breakneck speed, like a deck of cards being shuffled.  Tonight, my mental deck of cards is in the hands of a magician rather than a casino dealer.\r\n\n\n\nThe following slices of reality are processed and felt at the same exact time.  Sometimes In normal life I find myself multi-tasking; thinking about one subject while performing another task.  In my current state, none of the variations of reality take even a slight backseat as would normally be the case.  I seem to possess extra mental capacity allowing faster processing of my multiple minds.\r\n\n\n\nMy minds:\r\n\n\n\n    1. The actual visual field in front of me (what I am physically seeing)\r\n\n\n\n    2. The mental activity that is wondering: \u0093why does this stool and stove stand out\u0094\r\n\n\n\n    3. How am I going to describe the separation of these \u0093versions of my mind\u0094 to others after the experience?\r\n\n\n\n    4. A stream of thought trying to process the idea of these multiple realities\r\n\n\n\n    5. ?\r\n\n\n\nThe open eyed visuals are beginning to change, the stool and stove become less important.  My eyes are closing slowly.  Before they shut my vision goes through some reformatting.  Everything fades to completely black over about a second I know my eyes are still open, as I can feel them physically in such a position.  In my black field of vision a singular point of white light appears.  The shape is drawn from a single dot in the darkness that seems to be roughly ten feet from me.  The speck of glistening white grows and stretches, bending until it returns to itself and forms an absolutely perfect square.\r\n\n\n\nThe lonely square sprouts an offshoot from the upper left corner, which develops into a second square.  This second square shoots out a white line from each of its upper corners and these both become squares of their own.  Rinse, repeat.  Rapidly multiplying squares shower my vision as they explode in every direction: left, right, up, down, and then suddenly backwards and forwards; erupting into three dimensions.\r\n\n\n\nAll of this occurs, initiation to culmination, in the last few seconds it takes for my eyelids to shut completely.  My multitude of mindspaces is beginning to dwindle.\r\n\n\n\nThe mind that is thinking about report writing makes a note that I don\u0092t have any sensations in my body.  I can register that it is still seated in the position I last remember it being after my final exhale of DMT.  There is a slight vibration happening where my flesh touches the ground but this is barely detectable.  I am separated from my flesh carriage.  My body is not playing an important role in the experience at this point.\r\n\n\n\nAs my eyelids fall completely shut I see utter blackness that lacks any definable depth.  There is not a sense of the darkness enclosing me in a claustrophobic way, like can happen to me in floatation tanks or in actually enclosed spaces such as an MRI machine.  There is no infinite depth either, no sense of a galaxy expanding outwards in front of me.\r\n\n\n\nI see the outline of a bone.  Perhaps a femur?  It is very generic, like a halloween costume.  The outline is a dull white.  Similar in intensity but drastically less shimmering than the wave of cubes.  The single bone bursts upwards and leftwards, multiplying as it moves across the darkness.  The effect is very similar to the deck of cards that repeatedly bounces downward after winning solitaire on an old computer.  The bones move at about half that pace however.  I register perhaps twenty duplicates that move in a singular arc.  After roughly three seconds they transform.  The bones skip from an old school computer graphic to something beyond today\u0092s most advanced visual technology.  Each of the twenty odd shapes break out into three dimensions.  In a split second a simplistic series of lines generates an incomprehensible number of coordinated objects, like a flock of sparrows or school of fish, moving in a way that makes the group of individuals appear to be a single item.  The crowd expands in each cardinal direction.  While the sheer mass and complexity boggles my mind, the section of the group that is shooting towards me holds my attention more than any other.  The shapes remain 2-D despite their worldly movement.  The result is like an infinite mirrors display that allows the white lines to overlap with their predecessors.  Each outlines reaches closer and closer to me until all I can see is black and white; singular bones, intersections, negative space, series of shapes \u0096 all of these hold my attention, utilizing my multiple mind capabilities seemingly, at the same time.  Patterns, abstract forms, and the original multiplied bone design are all mentally ingested at once.\r\n\n\n\nThe riot of shapes lasts about two seconds in my own interpretation of time.  An impossibly short amount of time to have taken in the amount of detail I did.  I have the sensation of lapsing out of time and consciousness.  This comes to me as it might when I emerge from hypnopompia after an alcoholic blackout.  Rather than time being stretched out, I seem to have been disconnected from it entirely.  I am roused from the trance I didn\u0092t know I had fallen into by a repetitive mechanical clicking sound.\r\n\n\n\nEach clicky noise is tied, connected by my brain somehow, to stubby bone shapes that are now raining down around me.  The two dimensional outlines no longer have a source.  They drop from above, and fall to below.  No pile is formed on the ground.  Instead they pass through the bottom of my visual field.  The white shapes that are closest to me are much smaller than I those seen from far away.  The ones falling directly around me are tiny: the size of raindrops.  I can feel these, like small in pinpricks as each bone contacts my body.  Each produces a sound like a peaceful typewriter being plinked in an adjourning room.  Both the sound and the physical sensation is pleasurable: relaxing and natural.\r\n\n\n\nWhile the bones rain down, my point of view is an odd mix of first person and just out of body.  I see a very realistic rendition of myself seated in the exact position I truly am.  So vivid was this visualization, I thought for a moment my eyes were back open.  I am not watching from above, but rather from about a foot above my right shoulder.  Most of what I see is parts of my body that would be in view from a first person angle.  I can also see my upper back and a small bit of my neck and head.  The ability to see these cue me into the fact that I\u0092m still in a closed eyed visual world.\r\n\n\n\nThe visual effects feel very much so like a blending of the two chemicals I have taken.  The precision in the details feels like DMT but the colorlessness and static movement seems to draw from the ketamine.\r\n\n\n\nMy mental space feels expanded.  I\u0092m transcending above my point of view, seeing the room from higher than my seated position.  It is proving difficult to pay attention to anything except the visuals and turning away is next to impossible; I\u0092m transfixed.\r\n\n\n\nThe bones swirl in a circle hung vertically in the air so that I stare through the center like the letter \u0093O\u0094.  Their pattern of motion is slow and smooth.  I can see the \u0093normal\u0094 kitchen on either side of the psychedelic shapes, and even through the center of them.  The bones go slower, slower, slower; and finally pause in midair.  Things crank back into gear in the reverse direction and then rapidly accelerate.  Suddenly the rotating circle splits into four circles, each angling more forward than the next.  The result is a spinning (as a unit) and rotating (as individual lines) three dimensional orb made of the tiny bones.  This lasts just a split second before the shape collapses onto itself.  The four circles realign but are now spinning splat, like a frisbee.  Things are chaotic, the flat white color is developing into a shimmering display.  This fizzles and peters out in an anticlimactic finish.  I can sense this moment of coming to an end.\r\n\n\n\nI can feel the tryptamine taking over the dissociative, which has been slightly dominant for the immediately previous section of time.  The DMT produces a glowing calmness that is almost tangible.  A sense of awareness of and connectedness to the world.  There is no visual representation of these feelings, but it is as though the air is saturated with these notions and they absorb into me before exiting out, cycling the energies back into the world.\r\n\n\n\nI physically feel grounded, like an energy (source unknown) is keeping my physical body very upright.  I\u0092m still seated in the same spot but the supernatural energy has drawn me upright, making my spine straight and drawing my shoulders back.  I\u0092m very still both externally and internally.  There is no pulling or pushing, whirling or swirling, like I have experienced on heavy dosages of ketamine in the past.\r\n\n\n\nT + 01:12:17 [7:50 PM]\r\n\nI feel myself integrate into the room that I departed when I inhaled the DMT.  A bit of normalcy makes its way back into my mind.  My visual perspective is back to normal, the special \u0093viewpoint\u0094 is dwindling.  I am viewing the world from my own eyes and location in space once again.  The separate existences begin to come together.  The four distinct trains of thought still exist, but I find myself cycling through them rather than maintaining each at the same time.  \r\n\n\n\nI drop from a +++ to a + extremely quickly.  Perhaps I\u0092m slightly above a +, but in comparison to the peak, I feel drastically more sober.  This come down takes just shy of five minutes.  I start being able speak and take a stab at explaining what happened to Bodhi and Iroh.  My mind feels simplistic and I stutter with some \u0093umm\u0092s\u0094 and \u0093like\u0092s\u0094 as I attempt to convey some of the visuals and the multiple mental spaces I have just had the pleasure of enjoying.\r\n\n\n\nT + 01:17 [7:55 PM]\r\n\nThe strands of time begin to weave into a more recognizable tapestry.  The past fifteen minutes or so felt more like an hour.  At the same time, the peak of the experience seemed to transcend time: it had an immeasurable quality about it.  It felt as though time slowed down gradually as the ketamine worked its way into my system until about two minutes after the DMT was smoked.  At this point, I popped out of the time continuum, disconnected from ideas of \u0093short\u0094 or \u0093long\u0094.  I only recognize the time stretch now, from a perspective much closer to baseline that can comprehend the concepts of seconds, minutes, and hours.\r\n\n\n\nConversation becomes sparse.  Bodhi is preparing for a full tilt DMT experience with slow yogic breathing.  Iroh and I respect and contribute to the silence, happy to share a smile and nod before shutting our eyes and lying back.\r\n\n\n\nThe visuals on my eyelids are much less immersive at this point but I still have the ability to make them my reality with minimal effort.  Instead of watching them like images on a screen, I drift through them as a weightless entity; nothing more than a point of view.  There is only faint sensations of movement as I navigate.  I have some directional control to my movement but less so than in past strong dissociative experiences.\r\n\n\n\nThe landscape I drift through is unspecific and simple.  A mess of layered clouds laggardly rearrange themselves on all sides of me.  I drift casually, as though on calm waters, but the surroundings are giant and rough, like a storming sea.  The clouds around me are deep and saturated; burgundy and black, the colors melting and swirling unhurriedly into one another.\r\n\n\n\nI open my eyes and the change in scenery is startling.  I feel the influence of the ketamine almost exclusively.  Choppy thought patterns encourage me to think less.  The numbness that encompasses my body is pleasant enough to sit in silence and enjoy.  As I become more comfortable with my eyes open, adjusting to this reality, I realize once again that there are other people in the room.\r\n\n\n\nT + 01:25 [8:03 PM]\r\n\nI take a minute to write some notes in my notebook.  My handwriting is complete chicken scratch.  Feeling the need for water as well as urination, I stand for the first time.  I do so slowly, and avoid any major wobbling or stumbling on my way to achieve these two activities.\r\n\n\n\nWater is completely divine.  My dry mouth has been secretly craving hydration apparently.  The bathroom is uneventful, but something about the smaller space and harsher lighting makes me feel more intoxicated.  The texture on the walls shifts when I direct my gaze to it.  Slowly the lines of plaster wiggle around, snaking and sneaking their way into new patterns and formations.  I don\u0092t find this amusing or fun . . . I shudder to my core, the irrational fear of tripping too hard grips me tightly.  I wash my hands and dart back to join my friends.  As soon as I cross the threshold into the living room, the negative feelings dissipate.\r\n\n\n\nOur group tone is relatively serious.  Although I feel I have made it through the part of my evening that was potentially challenging, Bodhi is just beginning his.\r\n\n\n\nWe all settle into our spots on the floor and I handle the Volcano and scale.  Dexterity is slightly impaired, but several well practiced taps with the index finger of my right hand deliver the desired mg onto the tray of the scale.\r\n\n\n\nMy vision has a fair amount of visual static, my most frequently repeated visual across all of my substance experiences.  Currently, black and white dots about the size of American dimes dance, shimmering and glimmering.  The static is most obvious in the corners of my vision but a more delicate veil of the flickering black and white lays on top of everything in my sight.\r\n\n\n\nT + 01:47 [8:25 PM]\r\n\nThe crinkling of the Volcano bag is comically loud; what a sound!  The seriousness evaporates from the room as the three of us exchange some quick jokes.  Somehow the comical name \u0093Chris Crinkle\u0094 develops as a play on Kris Kringle.  The three of us are overtaken entirely by uncontrollable giggles.\r\n\n\n\nThe laughs are cut short as the pitch of the crinkling grows higher and the frequency more rapid.  The bag is full.\r\n\n\n\nAs I help Bodhi count the length of each breath I feel myself drawing closer to a sober baseline.  I have no issues  writing out timestamps and notes of Bodhi\u0092s body position along with other potentially noteworthy observations.\r\n\n\n\nT + 02+00 [8:38PM]\r\n\nI don\u0092t have any issues concentrating on note taking for the duration of Bodhi\u0092s experience.  Now that he is \u0093back\u0094 and beginning a quick yoga practice, I feel myself become more at ease.  We have all survived our peaks!  I retrieve a cold beer [4.6% ABV] from the refrigerator and it tastes especially wonderful.  Like a beer at the culmination of a hard day of physical activity; this tastes earned.\r\n\n\n\nT + 02:19 [8:57 PM]\r\n\nI have my second beer [4.6% ABV] as Bodhi, Iroh, and I begin to discuss what we went through for the past few hours [Not previously mentioned: Iroh has been dabbling in ketamine and a few light hits of DMT].  Thoughts are now forming in an increasingly normal fashion.  The more the conversation develops and spins off into random sidebars, the easier it is to forget I am coming down from anything.  Some minor tinnitus adds a layer of sound to the background, in addition to the mellow lo-fi music we have selected.  A natural but powerful sense of belonging to this exact space and time saturates all other emotions and coats every thought. A natural but powerful sense of belonging to this exact space and time saturates all other emotions and coats every thought.  From previous experiences I can confidently say that this is result of the ketamine trailing away, leaving me with the afterglow of the DMT.  This glow is usually relatively strong until I go through a full night's sleep and sometimes, depending on the content and intensity of the experience, can linger for days afterwards.  I couldn\u0092t be happier to sip my beer, bask in this glow, and spend time with friends.\r\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAdditional Commentary: \n\n\n\nThis was a solid, enjoyable, positive experience.  The visual effects were nothing short of spectacular.  Some of the white outline visuals felt very much like a strong closed eyed visual induced from ketamine.  The bones and cubes were minimalistic yet sophisticated and were highly integrated with \u0093reality\u0094: visible with my eyes open, in my kitchen.  Some of the things I saw appeared more as items in this physical world than as a \u0093visual\u0094 - they were very real.  Unique, strong, and immersive visuals: everything I was hoping for from this combination of substances.\r\n\n\n\nThe two substances played very well together.  Using the Volcano did away with my number one complaint about combining DMT with other substances. This being the difficulty of using an open flame and glass pipe or device while already heavily under the influence of a substance.  I found the transition into a deep DMT space less jarring and difficult when the take-off occurred from a ++ dissociative condition.  I was calmer, less concerned with the potential of a bad time, and as a result, able to soak in the entirety of the experience.  I have used alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, and opiates as launchpads for DMT in the past to try and ease this transition.  Separately from these, I have combined DMT with other psychedelics with the goal of exploring different visual and mental places.  This is the only substance thus far that has performed both the function of synergizing with the DMT for a unique set of effects as well as easing the entrance to the experience [I suspect other dissociatives would work in a similar manner].\r\n\n\n\nThe comedown from the combination was enjoyable.  That being said, I usually don\u0092t mind the comedown process when using either ketamine or DMT on their own, so I wasn\u0092t particularly surprised to find this true for the combination.\r\n\n\n\nI did think it was noteworthy how short the overall duration was.  An hour after smoking the DMT I felt there was nothing I documented worth sharing.  The lingering effects blended into the few beers I drank.  I achieved a \u00b1 condition by T + 03:47 [10:25 PM].  I don\u0092t think I reached a true baseline (to a -) until the next day.  Even then, there was the mysterious glow that created a little extra sparkle in my existence.\r\n\n\n\nMy immediate reaction to the experience was not one of emotional or mental growth.  There was certainly some internal analysis pertaining to \u0093how and why\u0094 my mind separated into multiple thought processing segments.  Mostly, I was impressed with the refreshing afterglow that radiated through me for the remainder of the evening after the last timestamp included in the report.\r\n\n\n\nAs I ruminated on  the experience, I was able to theorize some interesting parallels between the multiple mental computing spaces and my daily sober mind.  I don\u0092t think the details will be generally useful to anyone besides myself so I\u0092ll spare that detail.  The most useful of these thoughts were centered around the analysis of my general day to day indecisiveness and anxiety, and how they were similar to my multiple simultaneous perceptions.  I found both positives and negatives in this aspect of my personality.  The concept of being actively aware of these potential overthinking \"moments\" or \"habits\" and the related difficulties while they occur was profound and useful.\r\n\n\n\nA general happiness about life and appreciation for my position in it was the most obvious lasting effect from the experience.  It weened from a + intensity immediately following my last timestamp to barely perceptible two days later.  At this point the effect came and went, but was not particularly intoxicating.  It was almost indistinguishable from a boost in mood due to something as simple as a moment of sun at the end of a rainy day.\r\n\n\n\nAt no point during the experience did I feel the presence of entities (any sort of otherworldly being).  In standard DMT verbiage, I certainly peaked short of a \u0093breakthrough\u0094 experience.\r\n\n\n\nIn a similar comparison, I did not \u0093hole\u0094, which common nomenclature refers to as having out of body experiences on dissociative substances.  There was no feeling of sinking away from the world, or motion at all for that matter.  I stayed more present and \u0093first person\u0094 than other strong ketamine experiences I have had in my past.\r\n\n\n\nI had an interesting alteration in the way I processed time and existed within it during the peak of this experience.  It was not simply that I looked at a clock twice and the second time thought \"wow it seems longer than that\".  This was no simple linear stretching of time.  I was having rapid thoughts; far faster than I do sober.  Faster than most stimulants make me process ideas.  This was blindingly fast.  Unlike the fast visions and thoughts I often have on DMT alone, I was able to process things at the speed they occurred. Unlike the fast visions and thoughts I often have on DMT alone, I was able to process things at the speed they occurred.  Normally I would be left in the dust by the tryptamine's blazing speed.  It didn\u0092t feel as dizzyingly quick because my processing speed was just as rapid.  I stand on the earth while it hurtles through space at great velocity, but it doesn\u0092t feel as though I myself am moving fast.  That is how my thinking felt: I knew it was occurring at a tremendous pace,  but because I was keeping up everything felt more manageable.  Despite keeping up, I was still aware of the lightning pace, certainly more so than I am conscious of my speed traveling through space on a daily basis.  The truly amazing bit was that I kept up with multiple versions of ultra expeditious trains of thought all at the same time.  I also retained memory of many of these thoughts and visuals in such detail that I was able to document them in the hours following their occurrence.  This is not always possible for me.\r\n\n\n\nThe experience was powerful enough to make me want to repeat it.  To push things further even.  But also, it was intimidating enough that despite my excitement about the combination, it took me several months to put ketamine and DMT together again (even then it was at lower dosages of both substances).  I\u0092m sure the time will come to let one of these substances (or both at once if I can achieve perfect timing) take me to its terminal intensity.  When that moment arrives, I\u0092m sure I\u0092ll know \u0096 and I look forward to it.\r\n\n \r<br/>\nDosage Chart:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nT 00:00    35 mg      insuf.      racemic ketamine    powder\r<br/>\nT 00:21    96 mg      insuf.      racemic ketamine    powder\r<br/>\nT 00:53    31 mg      vaporized   DMT                 powder\r<br/>\nT 02:00    12 ounces  oral        Alcohol \u0096 Beer      liquid\r<br/>\nT 02:19    12 ounces  oral        Alcohol \u0096 Beer      liquid"

        "report_text": "My exposure to DMT came last year when I returned to visit the city where I went to college and stayed with some friends. Among them is J, who was there for my first few experiences with LSD and who is one of a small group of people who I trust completely as a guide and fellow traveler with regards to all things psychedelic. \r\n\n\n\nI was sitting on his couch doing some work one night when he wandered in and announced in his typical jovial way, \u0093guess what I got?\u0094. The glint in his eye told me before he did that it must have been one of a handful of chemicals \u0097 in fact, it was DMT. I didn\u0092t know too much about it at that point beyond the basics: it\u0092s physiologically quite safe, but puts you into a \u0093hyperspace\u0094-like state for about 15 minutes, during which users report shooting through eternal tunnels and meeting strange entities. J had already done DMT a few times and told me in no uncertain terms that I was in for a ride; we picked out a launch window for later that week.\r\n\n\n\nThe night before I was due to try DMT, I was sandwiched around the table at a social gathering with J and some friends. He was discussing in low tones the construction of \u0093the machine\u0094, the rig built out of an old beer bottle, a straw, some rubber cement, and some steel wool that was supposed to be an efficient way of consuming DMT. Another friend asked to see the machine, so we retired upstairs and J produced it. Out of curiosity I picked it up and inhaled through the straw, and immediately tasted mothballs and felt waves of profoundly peaceful thoughts wash over me. \u0093I think\u0094, I said, \u0093there might still be some DMT left over in this thing\u0094. I was mostly sober and buzzing more from the company of good friends than the two beers I\u0092d had earlier in the evening, so J suggested that I try smoking what was left in there to get a taste of the DMT headspace in anticipation of tomorrow\u0092s trip. We imagined that there might have been a few milligrams of the stuff left over from previous journeys; in retrospect, that might have been an underestimate.\r\n\n\n\nStill laughing a bit at the silliness of the dry run we were about to attempt, I took the plastic straw poking out of the machine into my mouth, as J ignited his lighter and waved it beneath the ball of steel wool, supposedly laced with the stuff, at the other end. \u0093Inhale\u0094, he said, and I did, feeling the pungent mothball taste now sticky and amplified as I choked down the smoke. I counted to ten, I guess, making a halfhearted attempt to hold it in even as I bucked and coughed. \u0093Again\u0094, and I inhaled once more. By now, it was already clear that something was deeply wrong. I could feel my body tingling with a brand new energy \u0097 heretofore undiscovered, but now familiar. The faintest background sounds \u0097 the whirring of a CPU fan, the faint chatter of guests downstairs, were amplified and reverberant. I felt my brain sift these sounds one by one from a river of noise, a power we all wield but rarely think about. I felt my brain sift these sounds one by one from a river of noise, a power we all wield but rarely think about. But instead of tracing these sounds to their source through familiar webs of cause and effect, my mind assigned each one a sickly, impossibly saturated neon color, and they buzzed in horizontal rows before my eyes. \u0093One more\u0094, boomed J\u0092s voice, but I \u0097 I? \u0097 was in no condition to move my body in service of taking a third hit.\r\n\n\n\nInstead, I sunk into the couch and closed, or maybe opened, my eyes. A field of tessellated red and purple triangles danced in my field of view, fed by cascading waves of terror. I felt trapped in an alien snowstorm, my visibility dwindling as I shone the flashlight of reason wildly around trying to make sense of where, or when, or who I was. \u0093I was sitting on a couch, and then I took a drug\u0094 \u0097 all the pieces of this simple thought were there, but I was unable to put them together in a satisfying order.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093I was sitting on a couch and then I\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093I was sitting on a couch\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093I was sitting\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093I was\"\r\n\n\n\nWith that, the old order of things buckled and gave way to a logical inversion across some sinister axis. The facts of my human existence, time, space, my body, and my mind, were incomprehensible, beyond recall or even recognition, while ancient, cosmic, Lovecraftian notions of being were laid before me as plain and straightforward as a multiplication table. My eyes, in real life, were open at this point, and I found myself in what I describe in retrospect as a sort of bioluminescent disco, its geometry taking only the vaguest of hints from the room I was sitting in, but all the more absurd for the swivel chairs still visibly strewn around the dance floor. I remember crying out with a mixture of fascination and revelatory horror, \u0093this is what existence is!\u0094 Immediately after must have been the \u0093blast off\u0094, because I felt myself suddenly pitched forward at great speed and shot though a series of lounge-like rooms.\r\n\n\n\nI wish, for my sake and yours, that I could describe to you what followed. There are characteristics I can relay \u0097 the surfaces glowed with colors both impossibly vibrant and imbued with an odd matte, stucco texture across which flashed patterns of indescribable complexity. One chamber seemed to unfold into the next not through a series of doors, but by its curled-up dimensions exploding into being from minute details in my field of view, like enormous turquoise-amber-violet popcorn kernels being popped. \r\n\n\n\nI remember this experience as bound by the laws of time: a linear sequence of events, one after the other. But I don\u0092t think it was like that \u0097 rather, I arrived at each chamber, at each moment in time, from a million different others at once, and each moment would soon explode into a million more. In retrospect, really trying to understand what happened is like looking through a kaleidoscope, turning the wheel frantically in search of some precise pattern I\u0092ve seen before. Sometimes I get close, and I\u0092m left only with the briefest impression of some otherworldly checkerboard vista and a chill down my spine before the pattern drifts again. Still, I have retained one image from this experience that feels like a real memory, a flash photograph snapped by my brain from a camera affixed above this transdimensional roller coaster and displayed in the gift shop as I exit. I see J sitting on a kind of velvet duvet, the walls made of pillowed squares and pulsing royal blue. In my mind\u0092s eye, though certainly not in reality, he is wearing a puffy top hat. He grins a Cheshire-cat smile at me, and either with his voice or some impossibly subtle gesture, conveys to me a single word: \u0093right?!\u0094\r\n\n\n\nI\u0092m really not sure what happened next \u0097 I suppose I\u0092ll have to go back in to find out \u0097 but as far as I can tell, I was rebooted. I occupied a sort of singularity, a point without space or time that was infinitely dense, but also felt infinitely spacious for lack of any kind of distance metric. From there, my human existence unfurled back into being from a single point in my life, being stranded in the Shanghai airport and missing my connecting flight. This is where the Turing tape of my brain had spooled back to over the last five or ten minutes, and so the first words out of my mouth were a feeble attempt to relay this out loud in Mandarin, coming up with the next word in the sentence before starting it over each time. The space I occupied now had a stained-glass quality, but it\u0092s more accurate to say that I felt as though I were made of stained glass, and the events of my life were beams of light shining through my colored panes onto the surface below, each new splotch of diffuse light helping paint a picture of who, what, and where I really was. It felt like coming to the surface from the bottom of a deep pool, or waking from a startling nightmare and finding myself safe in bed, but it had none of the anxious qualities I\u0092d associate with either of those things; rather, I felt a deep, beautiful sense of fascination and gratitude as I was handed a series of facts about my existence: you\u0092re a human being, on Earth, with friends, and family, and beliefs, and interests, and memories, and as I finally, at long last, grasped that \u0093I was sitting on a couch, and then I took a drug\u0094 my eyes shot open and I burst out laughing.\r\n\n\n\nMake no mistake, I was still tripping balls. The room we were in, while now satisfyingly Euclidean, was made of splotchy green geometric fragments that throbbed and swayed. The walls heaved and sagged, and J\u0092s face was an inquisitive treble clef. Still, this verdant space felt, as nothing ever had, like home. I probably could have closed my eyes and gone back in, but I was too excited by both what had happened and what I now saw around me that I could only gush in a stream of consciousness to my thankfully very receptive friends. I saw a laptop computer next to me and felt an indescribable awe and an odd kinship with this brick of metal which served to ferry our thoughts across time and space, and could be powered off for a thousand years only to be rebooted nonchalantly into its previous state. As things faded back to normal, and I realized that nothing about the lighting in the room was remotely green, I was left with waves of curiosity and newfound eagerness to explore the world that I called home, that I had left behind without so much as saying goodbye, and that I had now, miraculously, been born back into.\r\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE: After my experience with DMT, life proceeded apace in a shockingly normal way. I slept soundly that night and did the rest of the things I had planned to do on my trip, reflecting on what happened to me only in piecemeal, in the quiet hours of the following nights. Still, it had changed me. For weeks after, I would sometimes find myself briefly tumbling through DMT-space when awaking from sleep For weeks after, I would sometimes find myself briefly tumbling through DMT-space when awaking from sleep, with buzzing red and yellow spirals and zigzags quickly resolving into my ordinary surroundings. I took up meditation, trying to practice channeling my thoughts through the deep grooves of consciousness that the drug had carved for me, quieting the ego and the \u0093default mode network\u0094 of my brain and letting the miracle of conscious thought simply take its course for a few minutes at a time. The habit finally stuck, and has helped me to guide positive change in the way I relate to myself and others.\r\n\n\n\nThen there was one change that was most remarkable and remained undiscovered for about a month. One night I was out with a friend and shared a joint outside a bar in San Francisco. This was my first time smoking weed since doing DMT, and as I stood outside I found the pleasant buzz giving way to the familiar \u0093oh no, I\u0092m too high\u0094 feeling, which in turn gave way to something truly terrible \u0097 my vision went monochromatic and fuzzy like an old TV screen, and I crouched against the wall feeling terribly nauseous, small, and alone for what felt like an eternity until my friend helped me up and walked me to his apartment. As I took in the change of surroundings and found myself in a safe and familiar place, the nausea gave way to euphoria and I realized what was happening was a kind of farewell gift basket from hyperspace. I lay down on the couch, turned on some music, and closed my eyes, shot through tunnel-like scenes of indescribable beauty. I saw my network of friends morph into the nighttime streets of Munich morph into a long strand of DNA being unwound and translated into proteins. I became the Fourier transform and felt myself decomposed into waves. I toured a piece of code I had been working on and marveled at the familiar ways information trickled through its structure like marbles through a Rube Goldberg machine. I was every chime and glitch and buzz of Jon Hopkins\u0092 \u0093Luminous Beings\u0094. I saw myself as a healer, appraising my own flaws in a workmanlike and non-judgmental way, and feeling sure that I could learn to help others do the same. And all of that was before my friend brought back pizza.\r\n\n\n\n[Reported Dose: \"Unknown (likely 10-20mg, smoked)\"]\r\n\nIt\u0092s been more than half a year since I tried DMT, and the viscerality of the memory has faded, but sometimes when I can\u0092t sleep, or when I smoke weed, meditate, or even have a strong cup of coffee, I can feel those familiar, buzzing patterns of thought, and my mind grasps a unit vector that I know that if extended outwards a great distance will take me back to that\u0085place. I haven\u0092t made a serious attempt to find more of the stuff yet \u0097 I want to be ready, but I also hope somehow that it will find its way back to me. In the meantime, I think about DMT a little bit in the same way Carl Sagan thought about the stars: distant, but waiting."

        "report_text": "I am writing this experience outline approximately two years after it happened, so I am sure there are a few minor details that have faded since then. I will, however, do my best to recollect as much of that afternoon as I can.\r\n\n\n\nIt was lightly drizzling outside, sun creeping through the clouds. Stereotypical day between winter and spring. There was a subtle undertone of new beginnings in the air. The smell of petrichor as I walked up to my friends house set the mood for what was to come. \r\n\n\n\nI am greeted by two of my buddies, one male and one female. I walk with them to their room, in which resides a large tank of healthy and beautiful freshwater fish. I sit down on the side of the bed, nervously shaking for what I was anticipating. My friend, B, could see I was nervous. We spent the next twenty minutes discussing my anxieties and my expectations. I knew what I wanted to get out of the experience, and I knew WHY I wanted these things. I wanted to see some sort of objectivity; I felt as though I was drifting from my core, and needed some sort of knowledge that would assist me in becoming a better person. I had recently begun feeling more distant from family, and was beginning to have a sort of existential crisis. I was an atheist and had no belief or disbelief in any deity or afterlife, so it raised many unanswerable questions that would make me feel uneasy. I wanted to feel more connected, so I decided to do some inward exploring. This is where DMT came into the picture. I wanted to feel more connected, so I decided to do some inward exploring. This is where DMT came into the picture. \n\n\n\nMy friend B knew how to extract DMT from Mimosa hostilis root-bark powder, and taught me how to do it. We did a pull/batch the day before, so I knew exactly where this particular DMT came from. This got rid of any suspicion I could have possibly had. Before learning how to extract it, I did research on the substance and read experience reports. I wanted to go into this as over prepared as possible. Little did I know, it would not matter how much I knew about it, it would still be just as intense and flabbergasting. \r\n\n\n\nBack to the side of the bed: my friend B asks if I am ready. I tell him I'm as ready as I think I'll ever be. He puts a very small cannabis bud at the bottom of the bowl, and delicately sets the white powdered crystal on top. He informs me that he will be holding the bowl and lighting it for me, which puts me even more at ease. I put my mouth up to the pipe, and he puts the lighter near the crystals. He is very careful not to burn anything, just melt and vaporize. I fill up the pipe, and inhale. The taste and smell are ancient. The plastic-like taste runs through my whole body. \r\n\n\n\nAs alien as this is to me, I take another hit. This particular hit kicked things up a few notches: objects became more vibrant, matter was lightly pulsating, and this electronic hum in the air became significantly louder than normal. I had to take about 20 seconds to let it marinade. As I sit there, I notice that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was starting to blend with every moment. I felt as though certain human things were starting to dissolve. I somehow took my third and last hit, and B withdrew to give me room to lay down. \r\n\n\n\nThe electronic hum became even more loud, as though it's always there and we are conditioned to not notice it. This strong vibration took away my sense of free will, which was a magnificent thing to observe. At first, these alien feelings made me a bit scared, made me want to undo what I did. But I quickly forgot about my feelings, and became fascinated with what was happening all around me. I looked around the room slowly, watching objects fold in and out of each other. Colors I had never seen in this room were flowing like electricity. Golds, greens, reds, and unknown combinations of earthly colors were introducing themselves to me. I soon became overwhelmed, and decided to lie down and close my eyes.\r\n\n\n\nMy mindscape revealed itself to me to be related to matter, as it was folding in and out of itself in various dimensions. I watched infinite self-tessellating objects intertwine and glow gold and red. It was an ancient and beautiful pattern that I will never forget. At this point I wondered why I was experiencing this. \r\n\n\n\nWhat happened next is something I half-expected. I had read up on DMT experiences and knew many, if not most people, have interactions with beings. It was still not something a first-timer can mentally prepare for. These self-tessellating patterns began morphing into hominid shapes. Three beings appeared out of the infinity, what felt like right in front of me. In retrospect, it was INSIDE of me. They still retained several qualities of my mindscape: they were still tessellated next to each other (even though they seemed to be of a higher dimension), and their \u0093faces\u0094 were taking the form of something my mind could understand. I still remember their original forms: wide and happy grins, pitch black eyes, short bodies made of a seemingly unknown energy to me. But this original form soon became replaced with what my mind could make sense of: family. I saw my mothers face, my stepfathers face, and my uncles face. They were, without words, telling me they loved me unconditionally, and were happy to see me. It felt as though they were happily humming into my brain, trying to soothe me and let me know everything was alright. \r\n\n\n\nOnce I came to peace with my experience, they folded back into my mindscape. I felt the DMT loosen its grip, and I opened my eyes. Once I saw my friends B and L, I instantly remembered that I had inhaled DMT. My sober mind started to rise, and I could see things very clearly. I was shaking with excitement, and was rushing through my previous 5 minutes so I could remember as much as I could. I started analyzing every feeling I had during my \u0093trip\u0094, and tried to make sense of everything. As alien as the experience felt WHILE it was happening, I could not shake the sense of familiarity once I came back. It felt like I had been there before, a long, LONG time ago. \r\n\n\n\nI had come to a few conclusions about my experience at the time, conclusions that I still cannot shake. I felt as though the human condition/experience is partially created/monitored by endogenous DMT. When I inhaled the DMT vapor, I was figuratively turning the frequency dial on my perception. The subtle hum that I heard after the first hit was the sound air particles make when they collide and comingle. I felt as though humans had evolved to not hear the sound since it serves no purpose other than a minor annoyance. Another conclusion I came to was that our brains are programmed to take in certain input and turn that into a perceivable reality. By that logic, when I inhaled DMT I was reprogramming my brain to use different energy as input: energy coming from within instead of from the outside world. In my opinion, the beings I interacted with were a construct of the human psyche, possibly ancient. This would also explain why almost everyone who experiences DMT has contact with some sort of sapient entity. \r\n\n\n\nThis is where I will wrap up my experience in a nutshell: beginning of spring, went to friends house, discussed my apprehensive feelings with him, went over my goals in my head (wanting to become more aware and connected with things that matter), took 3 large hits in a time span of a few minutes, objects morphed and folded, colors became more intense, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu became more frequent, free will dissolved, humming took over everything, nervousness inevitably subsided, saw the beauty of the human mind, witnessed and interacted with 3 mysterious sapient beings that communicated without spoken words, perceived them as family, realized how loving and awesome my family is, realized how complex the universe really is and how I need to be at peace with not knowing most things, and realized how I need to value this moment to moment experience. \r\n\n\n\nOverall a very positive and very intense experience, and was my only time using DMT. I think the reason I had such a positive experience was a combination of the DMT being very pure (white crystals extracted by my friend B and myself), the weather being promising, my friends being quiet and mature, and my willingness to learn what I could from such a bizarre experience. I know I will use DMT again some day, but only when the circumstance presents itself in a proper fashion."

        "report_text": "First, a little background information to provide some context for the trip.  This experience was going to be the second DMT experience of my life and I was extremely excited for it, feeling a definite charge through my body as I picked up the bowl and contemplated the hit and what it was going to do to me.  Having just had my first DMT experience 24 hours earlier, I was more than aware of the incredible rush that was going to blast me immediately after the hit and to be honest, I was a little intimidated by it.  During the first experience, I blasted through the veil immediately and was thrown out into this gigantic open space, where I was shown innumerable images and events.  The emotions I was experiencing in that place were that I was 'home' and that I had been there SOOO many times before.  These were some of, if not the strongest emotions I have ever felt in my life. It had felt like an incredible revelation was thrown in my face, and yet it was the most obvious thing ever to me. I was jubilant, and you can easily see from the first trip why I would be so excited for the second.  Anyway, to the trip:  \r\n\n\n\n6:40 pm\r\n\n\n\nIn my friend's lounging room with all lights off, and with 7-8 candles burning.  3 close friends are present, and my mindset all day has been gearing towards preparing for this moment.  My previous trip left me with an incredible sense that I needed to trip again, almost as if I was being called back into the DMT lands to be shown more.  The DMT is packed in a water pipe, with a thin layer of weed above and below it for a buffer.  After taking about 15 minutes to meditate and get myself centered I decide it is go time, empty my lungs, and lean forward to the pipe.  Taking  one gigantic hit is the style I have adopted for smoking DMT, and as I released the smoke and leaned back into the couch, reality melted away.  It appeared as though I was passing backwards through a portal.. total tunnel vision.  Simultaneously I was experiencing/hearing the loudest, most electric shredding sound that I have ever heard/experienced.  It must have been the fabrics  of time shredding, because after this moment I was no longer in the physical realm.\r\n\n\n\n6:41-6:46\r\n\n\n\nThis is the part of the trip that I have the most trouble recalling, and it was no doubt the most intense part as well.  I distinctly remember the feeling of being home again, I was DEFINITELY, no question in the same place that I had gone to on my first trip, and even further down the rabbit hole this time :) I was feeling the feeling of infinity much stronger than my first trip, and it seemed like I belonged in this realm this time around.  I was there for so long, it really cannot be put in to words.  In fact, my entire trip consisted of two distinctly different experiences, one in body and one out of body, but both of which lasted what seemed like an eternity.  Unfortunately for me I do not remember much about what I saw in this place, but what I was able to bring back with me was that I remember the choice I was given when I left that place.  I DISTINCTLY remember having the choice to stay in this amazing place for another eternity, or I could return to my body.  In fact, up until this point I hadn't even considered my body or this world, but the MOMENT I had the thoughts that the drug would surely be wearing off soon and I'd be returning to my body, my consciousness snapped back into our physical realm.\r\n\n\n\n6:46-6:47\r\n\n\n\nNow this is where the trip really starts getting crazy.  At this point my consciousness is back in the room I had started in with my 3 friends, except that it is not really a room at all.  Instead, I notice that we are kind of floating in this beautifully golden aqueous space (similar to the wavy PS3 background, but in indescribable depth and definition)and I immediately understand this to be the place where reality is constructed from.  I try to sense my body, but it's completely impossible and I feel completely separated from it. I look around to try to see me body, and I can make out my legs, but they are what seems like many yards down and to the right of me (meaning the point of observation would have been somewhere above my left shoulder in the physical world).  I look to my friends, but they do not look like they normally would.  I can see WHO they are perfectly, but instead of bodies they are so abstract that I don't even know what words would do it justice.  My friends are clearly having a loud conversation with each other, except that the words make absolutely no sense to me and they sound like the craziest combination of hundreds of languages. They are radiating this aura of power, and I feel as though I am in the presence of some kind of council, except that they are not there to judge me but rather to offer support and reassure me. \r\n\n\n\nThere are many other sounds going on in the room, echos sounding off in all sorts of different pitches. Everything had an INCREDIBLY alien feel to it. I distinctly remember being there and listening to their pure gibberish conversation for a very VERY long time, and then out of no where it hit me.  the mega grand daddy DMT revelation. Literally as if thunderstruck, I am blasted with this overwhelming emotion that we (meaning myself, and my friends in the room) are projecting the reality we know as 'life' together.  And even further than that I can remember FEELING the other guys' energy within me, and I was overwhelmed with the notion that we were really all one entity experiencing whatever we want to in the physical realm, like constructing a play for ourselves to enjoy or to learn from.\r\n\n\n\n6:48-6:52 \r\n\n\n\nIt was after this wave of emotion hit me that reality began to melt away again. It seemed as though the room and my friend's physical existences would not be there when I stopped paying attention to them, but then as soon as I wanted to be back in the room I could be and it would re-materialize before my eyes.  I continued to toy around with this new found ability until I was abruptly sucked back fully into the physical world.  It was at this point that I opened my eyes and took my first look around the actual room I had started in, and then I realized what was coming next before it even started.  You see, during my first DMT Out of Body experience, after my consciousness returned to my body I went through a spell of about 5 minutes where I was shaking violently and consistently, but all the while I felt immensely calm and even pleasurable.  As I predicted, this happened again. For about 6 minutes my entire body vibrated with this incredible energy force that I have never felt besides when re-entering my body on DMT.  It is almost like pure ecstasy charging through my body as my soul reinvigorates my flesh.  After the 6 minutes I settle down into my body and my skin starts to feel like it glowing with heat. My head feels super charged.\r\n\n\n\nPost-Trip Rundown\r\n\n\n\nImmediately following the trip, one of my friends had a notebook and pencil handy and decided to start jotting down everything I was rambling on about.  This turned out to be an incredible tool when I wanted to go back later and remember certain aspects of the trip, because there are certain key words or emotions in the notes that will trigger entire memories from the trip.  It also helped a great deal in making this journal.  Really, the main thing I want to discuss from this post-trip conversation I had with my friends is this:  As I was explaining to them that I had sat and watched them carry out an alien conversation of gibberish for was seemed like hours, they told me that I had in fact not opened my eyes to watch them at all during my trip, and that they had hardly uttered more than a few words to each other, and when they did they whispered quietly to not disturb me.  This revelation absolutely blew me out of the water! Did this mean I was really watching them all the entire time through my third eye, instead of my physical eyes?? WOW :)\r\n\n\n\nMorning After\r\n\n\n\nThis is what I remember most from this entire 'revelation' ordeal.  I cannot remember exactly what the revelations that I learned in that place where, but I do remember asking myself during the comedown 'Will they allow me to share the information I just received or should I keep it to myself??'. This is a very strange thought, and yet I remember it as being exactly as I worded it here. This tells me that A. Clearly I felt the information was almost so sacred that people should discover it for themselves  B. Clearly I felt there were other forces that revealed this information to me, and I was questioning whether or not they would want me sharing it. I was very shaken by these revelations when I was in the moment, and not in the sense that I was concerned for my well being or anything, but rather just completely and utterly blown away by it. I was also VERY shaken and a little scared when offered the opportunity to leave this reality for eternity, no doubt that is why I am back here now.  However, I was also laughing like a madman on the inside knowing what I had discovered.  It's important to remember that regardless of what I say now to try to rationalize/put the trip into terms we can understand through this realm, I was literally the HAPPIEST I have ever been in my LIFE while realizing whatever I realized in that trip.  I also got the sense deep down inside that I wasn't fully ready to abandon our 'reality' just yet, so maybe that indicates that subconsciously I knew I had more to do on this planet yet, but really who knows? \r\n\n\n\nAnother thing that is interesting to note:  The night after this experience I woke up about 5-6 times into sort of a half awake/half sleeping state.  While in that state I could remember my dreams vividly, and I was moaning while laying in bed in something like ecstasy.  Now I can only vaguely remember the dreams, but I've never experienced anything like that before and am convinced my pineal/the DMT had something or a lot to do with it. Anyway, after an experience like this I have only the highest of hopes in regards to what DMT can show me about myself and the nature of existence. Still longing very strongly to try ayahuasca/changa to get a more lengthy experience, although there is no escape once in the heat of a trip like that! I hope this report helps someone make sense of something they've experienced that is as incredible as my experience was.  Happy Tripping :)"

        "report_text": "7:00AM \r\n\nWoke up very energized, ready for the day. Headed off to the beach for a morning dip, a cleanse after the emotional wake of the new moon the night before. \r\n\n\n\n12:00PM\r\n\nArrived at home, gathered the medicine. The plan was to drink a Syrian Rue decoction (3.5g) followed by 150mg of yellow DMT crystals with a friend, we\u0092ll call her Momo. \r\n\n\n\n2:00PM \r\n\nArrived at Momo\u0092s house. Placed 9g of ground Syrian Rue in a small sauce pan, added the juice of one lime and 2oz of water. Brought it to a light, rolling boil and allowed it to simmer for 10min. Added 1oz of water and allowed it to simmer 10 more minutes. Strained off the muck and allowed the tea to cool. \r\n\n\n\n2:30PM\r\n\nDivided the rue decoction into two portions and drank up. Not the most pleasant of tastes, sharp aftertaste, but it didn\u0092t linger for too long. I had only eaten a few blueberries and 2 cups of carrot/mixed greens juice around 11:00AM; Momo had a fruit smoothie an hour before the Rue was ingested. \r\n\nWe decided for one reason or another to smoke the DMT instead of ingesting, and went off on a walk to allow the Rue to take effect. We were not anticipating any psychoactive effects from the Rue, since most sources said more than 3.5g is needed for strong psychoactive effects. \r\n\nBoy were we surprised.\r\n\n\n\n3:00PM\r\n\nWalking along a railroad track, we both began to notice shifts in visual perception. The clouds would be sucked into which ever point of the sky we\u0092d focus on. Very light body feel, very similar to a low dose of mushrooms (but more aching to LSA.) We were talking about visual conditioning. The concept that fractal visuals and such experienced on psychoactives are the true faces of the natural world, a world that exist only in motion. We are raised as kids learning from books and pictures so we begin believe and are trained to see the world as still and unalive\u0085 \r\n\n\n\n3:30PM \r\n\nArrived back at the house. At this point we were really feeling the Syrian rue. The body feel was very drunk-like, slightly impaired motor function. \r\n\nWe pulled up a guided meditation by Deepak Chopra and sat down to take a look within.\r\n\nSurreal body awareness is an understatement. During the meditation, I had to open my eyes and check my body because it felt like I was twitching all over. Perfectly still. I felt an intense and quick pulse in my right arm and had to check the pulse on my neck to make sure. Slow and steady. Momo noticed me checking and confirmed the same feel of twitching and pulsing. By this time we were aware that we were just feeling all the minor functions and movement in our body that we don\u0092t notice on the regular. The meditation went deeper as the close-eyed visuals enhance. Black backdrop with small golden lights coming together to form small lotuses along the silhouette of where Momo was before I closed my eyes. As I would focus on the breath, the walls and all of this physical reality felt like it was right up against my eye lids. My physical body was never more apparent, and I could feel the fluids and breath circulating through all the channels. My physical body was never more apparent, and I could feel the fluids and breath circulating through all the channels. \n\n\n\nAfter the meditation, I walked to the car to get my didgeridoo (which proved quite challenging from the drunken body feel.) This sensation only occurred while moving and would take a few seconds to go away when stillness was attained. Pushing and pulling became very strange sensations. When I pulled the handle of the car, it felt like the whole world was coming towards me along with the door. When I pushed the door of the house open, it felt like the whole world was rushing towards me from behind. \r\n\n\n\nI sat on the floor using the couch as a backrest and began playing the didgeridoo. Momo sat on the couch behind me with her hands on my shoulders and began channeling her breath through her and into me. Playing took a few seconds to get acclimated to but then became so natural and fluid. The body awareness proved to be very useful to control the smaller details of sound. After a few minutes I stopped playing because I noticed a strange sensation flowing down my hands. I sat and observed, realizing that whenever Momo would exhale, I would feel a rush of sensations flowing into my shoulders and down my arms, out my fingers. As she would inhale, a calm would ensure - very similar to the rise and fall of the shore line, the water rushing in, and slowly receding. We both began laughing at the realization and the implications of what we were feeling. We stepped outside as the body feel began to weigh down on us. At this point, nausea kicked in.\r\n\n\n\n4:30PM\r\n\nThe nausea began to take me to an uncomfortable headspace. Momo felt a slight strangeness but no nausea till an hour later. I lay back on the grass which helped a little, watching little spinning/twinkling dots spread out grid-like in the sky. \r\n\n\n\n5:00PM\r\n\nWe came back to the house and straight to the couch. Any movement would be registered significantly more intense than it really was, which began to feel very uncomfortable paired with the nausea. After a few minutes of lying down, we decided to nap, and also decided not to take any DMT this time around, the Rue was more than enough for the moment and there was some discomfort. The nap was interesting, the body would rest but the mind was very active. We put on some Spanish medicine songs and vibed out. Listening to music was so profound. Every note was felt echoing within the body. Very similar to the first time listening to music on LSD. \r\n\n\n\n6:00PM\r\n\nWe got on up, Momo was going to shower. I began to play a flute and noticed myself a little more revitalized. Much less of the drunken feel, but definitely still feeling psychedelic. Visuals began to be more consistent trails as I would turn my head - as compared to abrupt and random visuals from prior. While she was in the shower, I decided I felt up to for the DMT so went ahead and prepared the pipe. I use a small bubbler without water. There is a screen with some, mostly burnt (black/ashy) dried passion vine. I placed ~50mg of crystals in the plant material, and placed another screen on-top (there ends up being about 1mm of space between the top screen and the plant material/crystals.) I\u0092ve found this setup to be very effective to vaporize the DMT, especially after the pipe had some resin accumulated. \r\n\n\n\n6:30PM\r\n\nBlast off. Nothing could have prepared me for what was about to happen.\r\n\n\n\nBefore venturing into this, I feel the need to share my \u0091experience\u0092 with psychedelics and the void. I have been exploring with plant medicine for a few years. I\u0092ve taken mushrooms (psilocybe cubensis) countless times from micro-dosing to 5g of penis envy. I\u0092ve experienced high doses of fresh truffles (P. tampanensis) and blasted off with Psilocybe azurescens (peak waves were on par with DMT breakthroughs). Smoked DMT over a dozen times with three being full-blown breakthroughs. Also have sat in one Ayahuasca ceremony and two Peyote ceremonies, and taken peyote out of ceremony several times. I have messed with LSD over two dozen times but never exceeded two stamps. I meditate daily and have been practicing Kundalini yoga for two years. I am very fond of astral exploration, a true psychonaut at heart strongly rooted with plant medicine and experiencing the great mystery to its full extent. I have always taken pride in being able to find peace in these altered states of consciousness, and consider it as part of my journey to explore these realms and share the fruits with my brothers and sisters in the form of music, herbal wisdom, body work and the origin of it all, love.\r\n\n\n\nI mention all of this to stress the intensity of this experience. It made any amount of mushrooms or DMT seem like a walk in the park. It is to date the most INTENSE and paradigm/life-shattering experience I have ever lived through. I would NOT recommend this to anyone who does not have a profound background with psychedelics, and even then I caution to proceed with much mental preparation. \r\n\n\n\nSo Momo lit the bowl for me. I saw the crystals beneath the screen melt, tasted the vapor travel down my throat. One pretty large toke (I should have stopped here\u0085) Half way through the second toke I began to feel the DMT onset. The vibration, the humming, the oscillating visuals. Went in for a third toke, already feeling this reality tearing away. I closed my eyes and saw striped women revealing a gate, but it was pulsing, opening and closing, opening and closing. Up to here it was very familiar, the visuals were familiar, the feeling and sounds were familiar, except things were significantly more intense and I felt a commotion\u0085 \r\n\n\n\nI believe in layers. There is the physical/material layer which we see on a day to day. Then there is the energy realm, which is where we\u0092d see chakra systems and meridians and those Alex Grey paintings we love so much. Then I believed there was the DMT layer. The onset was very much like curtains revealing the layers one by one, and when I got to the DMT layer, that very fabric was being ripped apart and I honestly freaked out. The beautiful palace that is revealed on DMT was being split right down the middle by a piercing white light. I felt the tension of the final layer of reality, I felt it tear right down the middle and I went on a downward spiral from there. My very essence (this goes beyond visuals) began to break down and I watched all that I am poof off into fractals until there was nothing but white. Very quickly I watched myself be reassimilated and I opened my eyes to find the room disintegrating into the void, and just as quickly my whole essence and consciousness split up into little fractals and there was nothing but void. Then quickly everything came back together. This cycle kept repeating over and over, over and over, being torn apart and rebuilt.\r\n\n\n\nThis went beyond sensations and visuals. My ability to THINK would break off into a fractal and disappear into the void. The ability to perceive would break off into a fractal and disappear into the void. I kept thinking this was it. I went too far. I peered too deep. I kept trying to tell myself that things will be okay tomorrow but the very concept of tomorrow would be ripped away. I thought of my family and that would get ripped away. I started thinking about everything I hold dear and that would get ripped away. I came to terms with my death, but even that would get ripped away. I felt like I was going to be stuck in the constant build/rebuilding process forever. Part of the issues was that it was happening so fast, there was no space to get comfortable. Anytime I would focus on a visual, on an idea, on a concept, it would fractal off and drag me into the void with it.\r\n\n\n\nI somehow crawled over to Momo and placed my head on her lap, talking was impossible save a few grunts of desperation, moving was beyond me. She noticed that things took a bad turn. She put her hands on me and began to repeat \u0093breath in love, exhale gratitude\u0085 Breath in love, exhale gratitude\u0094 Her voice and being able to kind of see her behind the crazy wall of DMT visuals felt like the only connection to human-life as I knew it. Controlling my breath was difficult, and would be calming for a few seconds before reality would disassemble again.\r\n\n\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity but turned out to be a few minutes, she helped me get to a bed in the other room. I don\u0092t remember the journey to the bed except strange bubbly cones floating in Salvador-Dali meets futuristic computer animations, kind of reminded me of trippy screen savers back from window 98. I lay in bed for a while unable to move. I was beginning to get used to the assembly/disassembly of reality but it had in no way reduced in intensity. I was beginning to get used to the assembly/disassembly of reality but it had in no way reduced in intensity. I started gaining awareness of my body for the first time since it began. It felt like surges of electricity were traveling through me, I could feel and see sparks and tingles pulsing through me. \r\n\n\n\nI was still in a state of fear and panic, thinking was still near impossible. But here is where the learning began. I want to note that in every other psychedelic experience I\u0092ve had, no matter how fully the void presented itself, there was always a presence. In this void, there was no presence. There was no \u0091mother\u0092 of \u0091father\u0092 or \u0091ancestors\u0092 presence. There was literally, nothing. I realized that I was worrying about people close to me. I started realizing that as I was being disassembled, the last things I was able to hold on to were those things I valued, but then even those things were ripped away. It got to the point that I was seeking comfort in the ability to think and perceive and even that was ripped away. I was sure something in my brain short-circuited.\r\n\n\n\nThe experienced started to lessen but still no assurance of it passing soon. We had ordered food for pick up before the blast off, and while they said it\u0092d be ready in 20min I\u0092m sure by now half an hour had passed. I was able to kind of talk now, I was entering a more familiar place but still in complete and utter shock. Everything was still being periodically broken apart into nothing and then back together again. Momo realized I was easing out, and said asked if I was okay to be left alone so she could go get the food. I agreed and just asked for my phone. She left and I managed to dial my girlfriend because at that moment all my entire being desired was comfort. My phone was coming apart and coming back together too, somehow I managed to get in contact with her and I closed my eyes and began to speak.\r\n\n\n\nWords have never left my mouth in such fluidity and grace. I quickly told her what I had taken and a brief explanation of what I was feeling and of my panic. I explained to her that there is no I. All we are is a vantage point of observation. We are not beings being shaped by experiences, we ARE the experiences. We are not being conditioned, we ARE the conditions. Without conditions and beliefs, there is no experience, there is nothing. We set up the conditions through which the Universe and existence can express itself through. The people we surround ourselves with give us the illusion that there is an individual but really all we are is the experiences and bonds we share with those people. I realized that everything that I thought I was being disintegrated into nothingness, and at the end, all that was left was a point of reference for the Universe to experience through. But without conditions, there was nothing to experience.\r\n\n\n\nTalking was so alleviating. I would close my eyes and become the words which took away from the experience of disassembly. Even though my words and train of through would spiral off into a fractal and I would have to pause to regain the ability to start forming words again\u0085 So many emotions came through, some tears, some laughing, much talk about my relationship with my family and general comfort. We spoke of the Sanskrit word Sat, which means truth. That was resonating so much as she would recite the mantra Sat Chit Ananda (Truth, Consciousness, Bliss.) When Truth and consciousness are combined, bliss is experienced. Sat Nam, Sat Nam, Sat Nam, I kept repeating for a while. The embodiment of truth. \r\n\n\n\nAfter some time of talking the cycling stopped, I felt much more present, much more intact. I opened my eyes and things were much more familiar. A nice blend of the Syrian rue from where it was before the DMT with a very profound Ayahuasca touch. Momo got back with the food, I handed her the phone and she spoke to my girlfriend for a bit while I recollected myself. I got up and stretched around. Trails lingering but I was just so happy to be back on ground zero. Never felt so happy to not be tripping\u0085 I checked out the clock towards the end of the conversation on the phone and it was...\r\n\n\n\n7:45PM\r\n\nI checked the phone later and my call went out at about 7:00pm, which means the intense peak reached a plateau for about 30min before I was able to verbalize to Momo that I was okay and was able to utilize a phone. The fractalization of reality lasted most of the conversation so I would say the come-down was about 30min and lingered for another 30min. Total time for the DMT portion: ~1.5hrs \r\n\n\n\n8:00PM \r\n\nI felt pretty normal, a feel good similar to low dose of mushrooms. Mind completely blown by the experience.  Heart overwhelmed by gratitude for all those around me and every being that has crossed my path and allowed me to experience this life. I realized so much about myself, about my values, about the fragility of life, about conditions and the truth of this human experience. \r\n\n\n\nIn hindsight, it was the most enlightening and cleansing experience I have ever lived. I would definitely try it again but with more mental preparation. I would definitely try it again but with more mental preparation. Knowing what I know now, I believe the experience would have been more enjoyable and easier to digest. I do acknowledge that fear got a hold of me, I lost my footing and the panic affected the ability to observe and take in the experience. But that is what I needed, sometimes we do need to feel fear to be reminded of the genuine and simple appreciation of this life. I thank Momo with all my heart for the comfort and compassion she provided during the experience.\r\n\n\n\nTwo days have passed since the experience. Still somewhat in shock. Occasional but slight flashbacks of the void and all the layers in between. Intensely patterned clothing has been over-stimulating and evokes the omnipresent presence of the void. \r\n\nAho creator, thank you for this experience. \r\n\nThank you, for taking the time to read through this experience \u0096 safe travels."

        "report_text": "[Erowid Note: \nThe dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] close erowid-warning \n\n\nI had been holding onto two DMT rocks for a couple of months, waiting for the right time to use them.  I had tried to smoke DMT twice before but with only marginal results.  The first two experiences produced only mild psychedelic effects: electric sensations flowing through the body and visuals a kin to LSD or mushrooms.  My ego had been left completely intact in both cases, and I had never really left the rooms from which I attempted to launch.\r\n\n\n\nEarly in the evening, I decided to attempt a new launch.  My roommate Echo was DJing a party somewhere and my house was otherwise empty.  Just after dark, I set up my zone, stringing my hammock up between two trees in my back yard.  I lit two sticks of incense at the base of the two trees and settled into my hammock.  I had decided to smoke the DMT using my Vapor Genie by placing the smaller, 60 mg, rock directly on the VG screen.  In the minutes before launch, I attempted to meditate, following my breath; this was very difficult, as my mind kept bringing me back to the idea of the approaching trip.  Many report that DMT is very intense, and as I had taken mushrooms and LSD at what I considered high doses several times before, I had at least some shadow of an idea what I was getting myself into.  \r\n\n\n\nAs I held the VG up to my face, my heart rate increased noticeably.  I became short of breath and felt quite nervous.  I began to hit the VG, but my lungs protested against the very slow hot stream of air and demanded oxygen.  I stopped mid-inhale and gasped for air.  Holding the lighter back to the VG I began to hear the subtle sound of the solid DMT popping and whistling its way into a liquid, and the sizzling sound of vaporization.  I continued hitting the VG, but never really felt a concentrated hit.  After about 60 seconds of hitting the pipe, I laid back in my hammock.  I felt only very mild effects, not even close to what I had felt on my previous two attempts.  Somewhat disappointed, I pulled out my glass pipe and took a few tokes of cannabis before falling into a peaceful slumber.\r\n\n\n\nI slept for a couple of hours, waking to a rekindled desire to attempt a launch.  I like to consider myself  a   truth seeker, willing to weather the uncertainty of alternative and expanded awareness in the attempt to contact and understand a more fundamental reality.  Given an adequately prepared set, an appropriate setting, the right tools, and the right chemical key, a curious psychonaut will seize the opportunity for learning, in spite of his nerves and reservations about the unknown.\r\n\n\n\nWith newfound resolve, I took my VG inside to reload.  Upon taking it apart I found a black gooey substance caked all over the screen, effectively clogging the pipe.  After removing the screen, I found the same gunk running down into the stem of the pipe.  The rock I had placed in the bowl was completely gone, but had evidently liquified and ran through the VG screen.  I replaced the screen with a new one, laid a thin bed of cannabis  and placed the larger, 170 mg rock of yellow-white DMT upon it.  I hoped the cannabis would catch the liquified DMT before it ran through the screen and away from my heat source.  \r\n\n\n\nDuring this process, my roommate Echo returned home from his DJ gig.  I told him I was preparing to relaunch, and I asked him to serve as my guide.  I've had mushroom and LSD experiences by myself several times before, and I knew I could very likely handle this experience alone, but deep down something told me that securing Echo as my guide was the right thing to do.\r\n\n\n\nWe went out to the back yard, and I relit two new sticks of incense at my hammock zone.  Echo sat in a chair facing the side of my hammock.  The cherried incense glowed orange through the darkness, and I was comforted by its familiar aroma.  I settled back into my hammock, covering my lower half with a blanket and holding the VG and lighter up to my face.  The nerves came back.  My heart rate increased and I felt starved for oxygen.  Again, I took a few minutes to consciously slow down and focus on my breathing.  I was a rocket quietly posed on a launch pad, awaiting the inevitable ignition sequence.\r\n\n\n\n'See you in eternity,' Echo said as I flicked my lighter and held the flame to the VG.  Again, I could hear the popping and sizzling of the vaporizing rock, but this time I got a concentrated vapor hit, complete with that subtle plastic taste I had encountered on my previous attempts.  I exhaled the white vapor and went back for a second toke.  My body began to buzz with the familiar electricity.  This buzz kept growing in intensity through the hit, and by the time I exhaled and began the third toke, it was growing with such momentum, I knew this attempt would succeed.  I continued inhaling, despite the  electricity now surging through my body.  The third toke gave me what felt like the thickest hit yet, and as I blew out the column of plastic vapor, I fell softly back into my hammock, body and mind disintegrating into a billion disconnected pieces, scattered across the face of oblivion.\r\n\n\n\n\u0085.\r\n\nAfter body and psyche are broken down and blasted out in all directions, there is only emptiness.  This is the clear light of the unformed, the un-become.  There is in fact no experience here that the psyche can preserve in memory.  This state coincides with the death of the ego and a discontinuity of recorded experience.  It would be impossible for me to say how much Earth time elapsed during this state of freedom; later Echo would tell me the silence lasted around 10 minutes.\r\n\n\n\nThe first flash of experience is a recognition of falling out of this emptiness.  Only after slipping out of the void can any conscious recognition occur.  As the clear light slipped away, I recognized it as sheer perfection.    It is identified as divine bliss; a state completely devoid of imperfections, impermanence, or dissatisfaction of any kind.  It lacks any hint of duality or ego and has a distinct impersonal quality.  \r\n\n\n\nJust after falling out of the light, I felt I had an opportunity to return to it.  This window is quite small however, since the fall out of the light is like the falling of an object toward the Earth.  At first the object falls slowly; enough energy directed upward may overcome the downward motion and return the object to its original position, but after some time, the object gathers too much momentum and there is no reversing the fall.   \r\n\n\n\nThe psyche pulls at one in the same way that gravity pulls a falling object.  The initial flash of recognition is produced by the first shred of the psyche reinstating itself.  As this piece solidifies, other pieces begin to solidify around it.  As more pieces of the psyche fall into place, the self-reconstruction process accelerates like an avalanche.  Timely application of just the right kind of concentrated energy could reverse this avalanche and return one to the liberation of the clear light.  However, in my case, the pull of my ego is strong and familiar, and affinity for the habitual inevitably pulled me away from the impersonal void and back into the process of reconstructing my psyche.\r\n\n\n\nAlmost the same instant that I realized what was happening, I knew that I had fallen past the point of no return.  The momentum of my fall back into the ego was too strong to overcome.  I began to fall through a sea of imagery collected during my current life.  All the people, places, ideas, and symbols I've come to know were interlocking and flowing freely like a fluid.  I experienced this vast sea of imagery outside of time, holding all of the pieces in awareness simultaneously.  Its scope and beauty were absolutely overwhelming.  \r\n\n\n\nDuring this period, I experienced several profound philosophical realizations.  I could see that the emptiness from which I had fallen was the fundamental state of perfection in the cosmos.  All efforts to make one's own life as well as others' lives 'better,' culminate in this state.  It is the attractor and the end of time, pulling the individual and the whole of life toward its perfection.  I felt that the purpose of experiencing life is to cultivate the qualities and skill necessary to find the clear light and to stay in it, without falling back into routine, ego-dominated reality.  This applies to the individual, as well as the collective of all living beings.  I saw that the cultivation of good mental qualities are essential to the process.  Intelligence, concentration, and ultimately wisdom are all necessary to make and then maintain contact with the clear light.  In addition, compassionate behavior or right action on the individual and the collective scale, is also essential to the attainment and preservation of divine bliss.\r\n\n\n\nThese realizations felt like sacred gifts bestowed upon me by the experience.  In my routine ego personality, I consider myself to 'know' these things already.  I attempt to study and understand the teachings of the Buddha and practice meditation, although the turbulence of life often distracts me from these efforts, and too often I find myself wrapped in the business of seeking out sense pleasures.  Experiencing the falling from the clear light and re-learning the significance and purpose of spiritual endeavors like the cultivation of good mental qualities and the performing of right actions on some very deep and real level of my psyche are invaluable.  This kind of intensely felt experience serves to keep me in touch with what is most important in life and what is the closest expression of my true unimpeded nature.\r\n\n\n\nAfter descending through the glistening sea of symbols and imagery, I began to encounter some turbulence.  As the psyche reconstructs itself, it becomes more and more fixed and solid, in contrast to the complete lack of form of the void and the flowing, fluid nature of the sea of imagery.  There is a tension felt around the crystalized parts of the psyche as the more fluid parts flow by, lapping and swirling into turbulent eddies.  As I felt this tension building in intensity, I remember uttering the name of my most trusted teacher, WW.  Her name serves me as protector during the unsteady phases of my psychedelic voyages.\r\n\n\n\nAs more and more of my psyche crystalized into a recognizable human form, my awareness across the sea of imagery began to hone in on one particular set of images.  Soon I was surrounded by the naked bodies of copulating couples.  I did not experience attraction or desire toward these images as I have before on LSD; I was simply an impartial observer.  Suddenly I felt an intense connection with my own biological mother; I felt her presence and noted the bond of love flowing from me to her and from her to me.  I realized that I was being cradled by the warm fleshy interior of a womb.  I sat up in my hammock, pulling myself into the fetal position.  .  I could see my physical surroundings for the first time, but I was bathed in softly enchanting red, purple, and blue light.  Soon I felt the enchanting  light slipping away, leaving in its place a deep sense of renewed purity.\r\n\n\n\nI had been reborn.\r\n\n\n\nThen I wept.  I wept and wept with joy and gratitude.  I was back. I wept and wept with joy and gratitude.  I was back. \n\n\n\nBetween sobs of joy I managed to articulate 'thank you, Echo.'  I didn't know how to explain to him how helpful and critical his quiet, grounded presence was to my experience.  The role of the psychedelic guide is complex and beautiful.  Somehow his grounded, non-doing presence serves to facilitate the smooth passing of the voyager through the various phases of the experience.  I silently honored my earlier intuition to request his service as guide to my session.\r\n\n\n\nGradually my sobs became more like laughter.  The distinction is subtle anyway.  I was awed by the eery familiarity of the entire death and rebirth process, as if I had experienced it countless times before.  The DMT death and rebirth experience had just confirmed what I already knew deep down.  The purpose of life is to make life better for oneself and all other beings.  This gradual incremental process of making life better a tiny bit at a time culminates in the divine bliss felt just after the break up of the body and psyche.  This state of un-become perfection is the attractor at the end of cosmic time.  To recognize it and to maintain it requires the systematic development of good mental qualities like concentration and awareness.  It also requires the performance of compassionate actions in the physical world.  These efforts, made diligently enough shall deliver the individual and the collective of all life in the cosmos into the divine state of perfection.  Into the mind of God.\r\n\n\n\nThis first true breakthrough DMT experience contained at least as much depth as I've found in the peaks of my high dose mushroom and LSD experiences, but with a laser-like succinctness.  The main distinction I notice is the duration.  The entire experience is condensed.  The various aspects of the experience flow by at mind numbing speed, making it potentially even more difficult to retain and integrate any lessons learned or realizations attained.  The retainable content of the experience begins only after one falls out of the void and lasts through the rebirth back into the familiar personality.  This fall takes only a few minutes to bring the voyager all the way back to baseline, routine reality.  \r\n\n\n\nAfter reflecting on my experience, I returned to my bedroom and slipped into a peaceful slumber.  By the next morning, as I write this account, the original content of the deeply felt philosophical realizations has all but faded.  I am left with the words I used to articulate the realizations and the memory that these words were connected to a very real, profound experience.  Time will reveal how this DMT trip will affect my choices as a human being, navigating through the dream we all call routine waking reality."

        "report_text": "DMT and the Origin of the Psychedelic Experience - A Retrospective\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an alkaloid that is found in many plants. It has a profound effect on the human brain via its action as a serotonin receptor agonist, giving it the ability to induce powerful psychedelic states. It also, together with psilocybin mushrooms, has a long history of human use and is an active component in traditional ayahuasca brews which originate with the shamans of the Amazon.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn this retrospective, I first talk about the DMT experience, including my own experiments with this substance. I then go on to compare it with other psychedelics, talk extensively about the neurological origins of psychedelic states, and finally discuss the question of their objective reality.\r<br/>\n \n\nWhile I have sampled various psychedelic drugs over the years, I always felt afraid of DMT. I thought that I would never try it because of its reputation for bringing on overwhelming experiences. It sounded too intense. I have experienced a number of anxiety attacks under the influence of LSD or mushrooms, and I thought that I would not be able to handle something with such an extreme effect. Additionally, I am very sensitive to psychedelics and doses listed online are typically much too high for me. Despite these concerns, I remained highly interested in trying DMT eventually.\r\n\n\n\nAt some point in 2011 the opportunity arose to try DMT at just the right time where I was feeling adventurous but relaxed in a great setting. I decided to give it a go. Having had no experience before of this substance, I was lucky that the dose was at about the right level for a full-on first time exposure, because getting the right dose with DMT is often problematic.\r\n\n\n\nI took a hit of a DMT pipe and held my breath for a few seconds. I had just enough time to focus on passing the pipe back and breathing out and then back in to get a lungful of air. I had just enough time to focus on passing the pipe back and breathing out and then back in to get a lungful of air. After that I pretty much lost touch with my body. I remember saying 'wow, a lot of rainbows!' It felt like a weight pressed me down into the ground while a rapidly increasing set of psychedelic visions built up to an intensity that I had never experienced before, and I entered a complex animated neon room of incredible machine-like digital impressions. I was feeling completely astonished and thinking 'how can this be possible?'\r\n\n\n\nQuickly I was overtaken by the thought that this was not really a drug, but that I was actually being yanked forcibly into other dimensions. I became a completely dissociated speck of consciousness in a vast spherical mandala of vibrant color and patterns. Strangely, I felt that my rational mind was preserved through this roller-coaster ride. I moved rapidly past the resonant mandala state into a wide open landscape and felt that I was flying through the air over a coastline and above a beach constructed out of beautiful flowing fractal imagery - it was a fully immersive all-encompassing experience with no perception of my physical body.\r\n\n\n\nIt seemed that there were entities there that were very happy to see me arrive, telling me that they had been waiting for me. Although not in fact visible, and only felt as presences, they seemed like alien parents, and I felt like a newborn baby, or a fish out of water, flopping around and very much confused and astounded. They seemed eager to try to show me strange art and other things in such rapid succession that I could barely take it in, and they gave me a strong feeling of love and encouragement. They were pleased that I had finally made it to this place. \r\n\n\n\nIt was around this point that someone from the real world started talking to me and I opened my eyes and snapped back to earth. Later I was dancing to some music and it seemed like every move I made had multiple complex geometric reverberating patterns associated with it. The dose must have been fairly high as I was feeling the effects for around 45 minutes. \r\n\n\n\nI was very excited after this overwhelming ride and I felt very positive, but also a little disconnected. I began to realize that I was one of relatively few people who had been to this place, and it was hard to know what to do with it, and how to mentally and emotionally integrate this information. What was interesting about my experience was that because I did not intend to take DMT, I had never read in detail any trip reports, and so I did not realize, until I got home, that my own experience was pretty much the archetypal DMT narrative.\r\n\n\n\nI had a fairly hard time over the next couple of weeks going back to work and thinking about it all the time. I realize now that this is why the traditional role of a shaman or experienced drug guide is important, because you need someone to talk to who knows about the experience, and can help you work it all out in your own head. There are very few of those people in western society. I felt in a zone of being disconnected from ordinary people, and especially locked in an internal battle over how much was externally real about the experience, and how much was in my head - just a change of brain function brought about by taking a drug. This is a constant theme in DMT discussions.\r\n\n\n\nAfter that first time, I became quite experienced with DMT, taking it on multiple occasions, although it was always with some trepidation, and it never seemed like something that I wanted to do very often. As a scientist, I became interested in cataloging and examining the effects of DMT as I varied the dose.\r\n\n\n\nI have tried a few times smoking DMT repeatedly from a glass vaporizing pipe over the course of a couple of hours, which is hard on the lungs because it tastes so awful, but it does give a slow burn of DMT intoxication that allows you to approximately control the level, dipping above and below the comfort zone with each toke. This makes it easier to acclimatize to the effects and observe progressively higher doses. One could perhaps take DMT intravenously with saline in a continuos manner to maintain a steady level, although presumably someone would have to facilitate this experiment in a medical setting. \n\n\n\nThe nice thing about DMT is that it is so rapidly metabolized, which allows me the confidence to know that it will be over soon if I get to a difficult place.\r\n\n\n\nNext I want to talk a bit more about the effects that I experience at lower doses and then compare it to experiences with other psychedelics, especially psilocybin mushrooms. I'm also going to talk about the neuroscience and the debate about the reality of DMT spaces. \n\n\n\nThere is sort of a hallowed feeling to the DMT experience as though I have entered a large space like a cathedral. In part this might be related to the echoey effect of the audio distortions. With my eyes open, everything begins to look very flat or cartoon-like such that the interior shading to walls and objects is missing or washed out and just the edges are maintained, similar to the rotoscoping effect from the movie 'A Scanner Darkly.' I also have the same experience on psilocybin mushrooms.\r\n\n\n\nWith stronger doses, the visual edges of things start breaking open to reveal bright rainbow-colored fractal noise. Specifically, when I am 'going up' on either DMT or mushrooms, contours in the visual field - edges of walls, or chairs, or other edges in normal visual perception - seem to split in color and become rainbow edges, leaving behind patterned tracers, and becoming the sources that unfold into a more complex psychedelic experience.\r\n\n\n\nThe auditory effects for me involve tinkly metallic sounds like someone dropping ball bearings on an infinite metallic plate, or a crackling sound, like crumpling up mylar. I also experience quiet phaser sounds like little baby ray guns going off, sometimes longer and shorter but with a falling pitch, not made of a pure tone but made of pink noise. Interestingly, I find the sounds quite similar to audio-domain recordings of very low frequency radio noise caused by distant thunderstorms. These sounds, called spherics, are the result of dispersing radio waves bouncing around in the ionosphere and can be picked up by a special radio. Here are some links:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n* http://www.spaceweather.com/audio/inspire/7purewhist.mp3\r<br/>\n* http://home.pon.net/785/natural.htm\r<br/>\n* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeuI8AJMIxU\r<br/>\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_atmospheric\r<br/>\n \n\n\n\nI'm not suggesting that the brain picks up these signals, but I do think the mathematical mechanism of frequency-domain smearing of noise bursts may be common to both of these phenomena, particularly as this is very much the analysis that the brain is doing in the auditory system - dividing sound into a number of frequency bands.\r\n\n\n\nWith my eyes closed, I start to see patterns that consist of neon or laser-bright lines of intense red, green, blue, or yellow in geometric structures that seem to pop in and out or move in a digital fashion, presented in a vast space which I call the 'Electric Room.' These patterns seem to be always moving and fitting into each other like Tetris blocks, or coming and going into and out of alignment, or else queueing up and being released, like those speeded up videos of cars moving through city intersection stop lights from the movie Baraka. The sounds also seem to synchronize with these motions. Other patterns I have experienced include intricate evolving 3D fractals, and flitting 3D tracers like the changing structures of light in a plasma globe.\r\n\n\n\nThe initial body sensations consist of a heavy downward pressure that seems like weighty geometric patterns of touch pressing down over my chest and arms The initial body sensations consist of a heavy downward pressure that seems like weighty geometric patterns of touch pressing down over my chest and arms, so I feel like I am being vacuum-sealed in chicken wire or some patterned membrane is pressing on my body. This really accentuates the feeling that some outside agent is doing something to me \u0097 along the lines of sleep paralysis experiences or alien abductions. However, it probably has its origin in structured patterns of touch hallucinations that arise within somatosensory cortex and are experienced as though mapped onto the body surface, in the same manner as the visual cortex is involved in visual hallucinations. These patterns of pressure points on my body and face seem to rapidly move around, as if my body is a skating rink and lots of miniature but heavy skaters are tooling around on it in a haphazard fashion.\r\n\n\n\nWith progressively larger doses I experience a growing disconnect from my body, sometimes with a loss of spatial awareness and the idea of the direction of gravity. It is a bit like when you go camping and lie on your back and look up at the stars and imagine yourself oriented vertically and looking out horizontally from a vast wall which is the earth. Your normal embodied presence seems to fade out and spatial directions become ambiguous. This is also quite similar to the experience of ketamine intoxication.\r\n\n\n\nWith regards to what people often call the 'body load' of the psychedelic, it seems like DMT has a feathery light quality to it without a lot of tension or waves of difficult muscle contractions or gastrointestinal spasms like the ones that one can get on LSD, cannabis (sativa), or 2C-B. It seems to be rather more sleep-inducing than stimulating, certainly less stimulating than LSD with very little restlessness or desire to get up and move around. I have felt like I have fallen asleep taking DMT late at night.\r\n\n\n\nWith larger doses everything I experience seems to open up into multiple things in some kind of chaotic fractal period doubling. At some critical moment I pass a point of total disembodiment where the visual field and perhaps all sensation becomes a vast and static brightly colored mandala - a saturated feedback point or stable eigenvector of sensation, like standing waves of color and structure, like fine powder patterns on a metal plate vibrating in a sound field, or like the resonance of a bell.\r\n\n\n\nThis tends to be the moment where I really jump off into alternative worlds, it is the point where I am forced to give up trying to pay attention to specific senses, and instead I enter a pan-dimensional psychedelic dreaming. It is no longer shapes and colors but concepts and images of alien places and landscapes, cities, or machines, and there starts to be a narrative to it as opposed to a simple temporal motion structure. There seems to be a certain characteristic evolving pace to everything, and while the content changes, this pace nevertheless remains constant. There is also the possibility of feeling extremely strong emotions, like feeling incredible love, or ecstatic states; presumably also fear or malevolence, however I personally have never felt that way to date.\r\n\n\n\nIt is hard to tell how much of this content is common from individual to individual. I am a very visually oriented person and so I experience and describe very intense visual phenomena. Presumably if you are a professional composer of music you might have many more auditory experiences than I have described here, or a different person might experience more interpersonal narratives.  I know people who say they barely ever experience visuals, even on DMT - so called 'DMT non-responders' who may have a somewhat different distribution or density of certain types of serotonin receptors than more responsive individuals.\r\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to compare the effects of DMT to those of other tryptamines, for example LSD and psilocybin mushrooms. These three have a lot of similar qualities but differ in the time course and the level of physical stimulation that one experiences (meaning the need to move around), with DMT being less stimulating than LSD. Also there is a different confusion factor for each, which I would define as the amount of sensory distortion experienced for the same level of executive function loss (executive function being the ability to make decisions and maintain a feeling of control). \n\nOne of the nice things about DMT is that it produces a great deal of sensory distortion but at the core I can almost feel sober and able to rationally experience what is happening, even at fairly high levels of bodily disconnection. Eventually, with a large dose, it is possible to disassociate and experience ego loss and the understanding of who or where I am. LSD, however, seems to produce confusion more rapidly with dose and it becomes difficult to maintain any train of thought. Mushrooms are somewhere in the middle. \r\n\nI would speculate that what is probably going on here is that LSD, being a wide spectrum agonist at a number of neural receptors has a broad effect across the brain, interfering with executive functions in the frontal lobes as much as sensory processing, whereas DMT probably has its main effect on receptor sub-types that are densely present in sensory cortex and only at higher doses begins to upset the functioning of the whole brain.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe study 'Psychedelics and the Human Receptorome' (Ray 2010), while his results have been hotly debated, provides us with interesting data about receptor binding affinities of various psychedelic drugs. From this we can get an idea of the differences between LSD, DMT, and psilocybin (psilocin) in terms of how they interact with receptors in the brain. According to this study, LSD has the broadest affinity for most serotonin and all dopamine receptor types, while DMT and psilocin both have effects at a more limited range of serotonin receptors and have an affinity for the D1 dopamine receptor. The main lesson is that these are not simple linear compounds activating one site (e.g. 5HT2a) but possess a complex spectrum of action. More studies are needed to pin down the specifics of the receptor binding data and to determine activation efficacies so that we can know how strongly these substances actually modulate neural responses once they are bound to receptors.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith regards to the stimulant properties of psychedelics, I think there is always an adrenaline component which is associated with the anticipation or excitement about taking a substance and the strangeness of the states that are experienced \u0097 especially with novices. With the various drugs that people take, this can add to whatever background effect the substance has on the body. Specifically, mushrooms and DMT don't in themselves have a strong stimulant effect and don't create that stay\u0097awake\u0097all\u0097night feeling that primarily adrenergic drugs like DOI or many phenylethylamines might possess. As a result they are probably safer and can be tolerated in higher doses to the extent that greater cognitive distortions are possible with the same safety margin. I think that when over-stimulation happens with mushrooms, it is more because of immediate experience or scare factor, where the body sensations are perceived as out of the ordinary and uncomfortable, making a person more anxious or worked up. It's more of a content related stimulus than anything caused by direct and constant action on sympathetic nervous system receptors. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is easy to get into an overstimulated and agitated state with mushrooms when situations around you are non-ideal, but when relaxed and happy, they don't seem to be strongly stimulating and are almost sedating in some way, often giving you the yawns and making you feel somewhat tired. Compare that with trip reports of drugs with a somewhat heavier background stimulation level. Even relatively mild phenylethylamines such as 2C-B can turn into one long anxiety attack at higher than average doses.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPeople have been known to take mega-doses of LSD - the 'LSD powder thumbprint.' Certainly LSD is stimulating, but reports of experiences of such large doses show that for the first hour or so there was extreme anxiety, but after a while the sympathetic recruitment effects are less as the person became more confused. This may be because great anticipatory fear is felt at the beginning, but later the cognitive machinery is so affected that conceptualizing the fear factor becomes impossible and the process of continuously imagining specific negative scenarios that typically drives an anxiety state is no longer sustainable, leaving only the residual pharmacological adrenal stimulation of the LSD, which is not dangerously high. (I do not advocate taking mega doses of LSD.) \n\nRegarding sensory distortions, my experience with DMT and mushrooms is that they produce approximately the same styles of visuals when normalized to dose, only with a different time course. The experience is unlike LSD or 2C-B. I experience closed-eye patterns of neon-like primary colored geometric wave fronts moving across the eyelids. I can lay back and allow these waves of color and pattern to pass over my sensorium, including waves moving over my body. It feels like a complex fluctuating around a relatively mildly stimulated sober state rather than a strong energizing wave with any unpleasant energizing depth; more like an overgrowth of strange fractal fuzz on the senses that gets more insistent with dose.\r\n\n\n\nWhen smoked, DMT creates a rapid and therefore intense experience which is hard to follow, whereas mushrooms give rise to a slow experience that lasts a few hours where I get plenty of time to think about the effects that I am experiencing. With mushrooms, most people do not choose to get to the extremes of intense psychedelic states that they would normally have with a few seconds of DMT. The feeling of assurance that you will quickly be sober after taking DMT allows a person to take much more of a risk with dose and therefore experience a much greater psychical disturbance. In other words, we can tolerate a very intense psychedelic experience when it is just for a few minutes, but not when we know it will be hours before a return to normal. The psychedelic visionary, Terence McKenna, has stated that he experienced very DMT like voyages when taking 'heroic doses' of mushrooms. Personally I do not have any experience with ayahuasca but it would be interesting to compare it with a mushroom trip because of the similar time courses. The harmaline ingredient of the ayahuasca brew is psychoactive and may bring its own component to the experience.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe psychedelic effect in general is a bizarre beast and one that needs explaining. Improved understanding in this area also has the potential to lead to better theories of cognition. For a long time our ideas of psychedelic mechanism has revolved around the serotonin 5HT2a receptor. Many research publications talk as though activating this receptor is the sole mode of psychedelic action. I think this is starting to change as scientists realize that psychedelic substances typically have a broad influence at a number of serotonin receptor sub-types in the brain, and also involve effects at many other sites, including dopamine, norepeniphrine, or opiate receptors, or at re-uptake transporters. This spectrum of action accounts for the variety of subjective qualities across the different substances that people take recreationally.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe cortical circuits maintain a fine homeostasis in order to optimize the signal to noise ratio of their representations of sensory information - to rapidly find the things that are relevant in a continuous onslaught of data. This provides a survival advantage, where the brain tries to compute the most likely hypothesis of what is actually taking place in the world; it has evolved to provide fast and accurate perceptions for potentially life and death decision making. Under sober conditions, the cortex computes stable invariant representations of the rapidly changing sensory patterns so that you can recognize, for example, a car at different distances, under different lighting conditions, and under different viewing angles - a level of stability which is remarkable in the face of huge changes in the pattern of light entering the eye. There is a sort of winner-take-all process taking place, where secondary hypotheses of what is seen are suppressed and the most likely interpretations are passed on to later processing stages. When multiple simultaneous hypotheses have equal strength, such as in the Necker cube illusion, the interpretation of the image flips between stable states at random.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOne action of psychedelics is to upset the balance of this system, perhaps by changing activation thresholds, adding noise, or reducing competition among neurons, and this allows a shifting landscape of multiple weaker hypotheses about sensory data to pass through and be available for direct perception. One can always stare at clouds and see cloud animals, but during psychedelic experiences these secondary interpretations have a high saliency and are experienced directly and without effort. One therefore experiences a proliferation of interpretations of sensory patterns beyond the most probable modes. There are many more ways to slice the pie than first meet the eye. The population of neural activation that encodes sensory information becomes multi\u0097modal or has a lower sparsity than during the sober state. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe excitatory and inhibitory clusters of neurons in the neocortex actually form complex dynamic systems which are capable of oscillatory behaviors. Neighboring neurons are highly connected and this provides a substrate under which quite complex oscillatory patterns can exist as a normal part of perception. One can think of regions of the cortex in terms of a sea of coupled oscillators with non\u0097linear dynamics. I believe that the pattern of activation of the set of serotonin receptors caused by the drug can subtly change the parameters of this system so that it supports characteristic waves of depolarization which move like ripples on a pond. These passing waves will sometimes raise and sometimes lower the local thresholds for neural firing. In fact such spontaneous traveling waves of neural activation have recently been shown to exist under normal circumstances in the visual cortex during blank periods between significant visual stimulation (Sato, Nauhaus and Carandini, 2012). It is likely that these natural waves become amplified during psychedelic states and take on drug\u0097dependent dynamics.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSuch spatiotemporal waves are a little like seizure activity except they do not grow without bound and are unlikely to be able to recruit large groups of neurons en masse, but instead modulate the sensitivity of the neural substrate to ongoing activity. One perceives waves of activity in motion across the visual field, or waves of touch or muscle stimulation. Often people talk of waves of energy, or current flowing through their bodies while taking psychedelics. The waves of electrical activity within the cortical surface are perceived as being mapped onto the body, producing amplified zones of sensitivity over constantly changing regions of the senses, or moving waves of increased muscle tone which can involve either skeletal muscles or smooth muscles of the digestive tract. These motor waves produce an evolution of tensing or relaxing both of internal organs and muscles throughout the body which are experienced as 'energy flow' or 'body load.'\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI would imagine that the exact dynamic behavior of these waves depends on the pattern of psychedelic substance binding activity across the different receptor sub\u0097types. This binding profile dictates a specific alteration of the spatiotemporal characteristics of local neural ensembles. One could explain the proliferating perceptual hypotheses of psychedelic states in terms of a raising or lowering of activation thresholds as each wave passes by; sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing the likelihood that a particular set of neurons will fire, and thereby changing the balance of salient perceptions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMost people prefer psychedelics with low body load. I think that what people mean by this is that they do not want a strong stimulating effect at muscles or within the gastrointestinal tract. Shakes, excessive muscle tone, poor coordination, or convulsions are not generally desired and neither are gastrointestinal spasms and frequent trips to the bathroom. Gut pain and tension often leads to anxiety states. As dose is increased, distortions of perception eventually lead to confusion and then to shaking and seizures during overdose, reflecting the likely spreading of activation beyond sensory cortex and into the frontal lobes and eventually motor cortex; recruiting networks in the whole brain. Possibly the density of receptors upon which the drugs act is different between these cortical areas, with large distortions of perception being possible for some drugs (especially in the case of DMT) but with minimal stimulation of muscle tension or movement because motor neurons are not easily recruited.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nOne interesting aspect of DMT and mushrooms is the cartoon\u0097like experience of normal surroundings. The visual system seems to suffer a reduction in contrast sensitivity so that low contrast details between visual boundaries are lost to perception. This could fit in with the almost paradoxical mixed sedation and psychedelic activation that people experience on DMT. There may be a diffuse background hyper-polarization of neurons (reduced sensitivity to inputs \u0097 or partial sleep state) upon which dynamic waves of increased hallucinatory activation are impressed. This would be similar to near-sleep states where neurons are hyperpolarized but exhibit transient bursting modes of activity and there is a build up of strong EEG waves, instead of the regular and relatively desynchronized firing during wakefulness in response to sensory stimuli (Weyand et al., 2001.)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is also common to experience fractals, a fact which bears some consideration, especially as it seems like fractals are highly artificial patterns which present as a surprising emergent property of altered visual perception. However if one considers the structure of the neural processing stages in human vision, it becomes easier to see that fractals could be an outcome of psychedelic intoxication. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is well known that the brain carries out a series of processing steps which start with the analysis of small regions or details of the visual image and proceeds sequentially via multiple neural layers to amalgamate information over progressively larger regions. The brain eventually produces patterns of response that are drawn from the whole visual field. During this processing the visual cortex constructs a 'multi\u0097scale' or 'scale\u0097space' representation which is part of the mechanism by which the neural apparatus is able to recognize the same object at different sizes and positions in the field of view. Thus we have a hierarchy of processing steps from retinal 'pixels' to neurons that encode stable semantic information. What is not often considered, is that information flows both upwards and downwards, and neurons in later stages send their results back down to their input stages - stages which are more closely coupled to the eyes. This creates a sort of feedback loop \u0097 a dynamic system which operates between coarse and fine spatial scales, and between the perceptions of the whole and the parts.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe property that defines fractals is their self-similarity between different scales; a complete fractal is made up of smaller copies of itself. If a spontaneous pattern that is present at a high level of visual processing can be impressed multiple times onto lower levels with the same pattern resonating up and down the hierarchy at different apparent size scales, then fractal forms may naturally result. In a simplistic example you could think of this as being a little bit like video feedback where a camera is trained on a television which shows images of itself. Morphing patterns ensue.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnder normal conditions the brain very finely controls the balance between bottom-up information flow which directly represents data coming from the senses and top-down modulatory influences which encode expectations of the interpretation of incoming sensory data in the context of current knowledge. In dream-like states and during normal task-based visualization, the sensory input is cut off by the thalamus and the brain iterates on top-down information. During psychedelic states it also seems that the top-down signals become highly influential and support radical interpretations of the senses which are then passed back up in a resonant loop of evolving perceptions. During this resonant process, latent perceptual patterns which are already encoded in the neuronal connection weights are allowed to be amplified and represented in the visual field in a self-consistent manner but with little regard to the normal interpretation of sensory inputs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRecently Google has demonstrated this type of behavior in an artificial neural network based on deep learning from natural image sets. This 'inception network' is allowed to evolve so that it amplifies those internal representations which are already part of its response to a source image. When rendered back into the image domain, the network hallucinates self-consistent structures based on information that it has learned through its training cycles. Extremely bizarre fractal 'artwork' is generated by this process which is very similar to the psychedelic experience.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs mentioned already, the brain starts by analyzing local features of the scene, such as edges and their orientations, and proceeds to abstract more and more complex representations. Neurons have been discovered that respond preferentially to hands and faces, or to the actions of other people, such as picking up food. In every sensory system, more abstract concepts of perception are progressively computed from simpler concepts through a succession of neural layers. One of the dose dependent features of psychedelics is that they start by producing simple and rather local distortions to perception, for example enhancing colors, or introducing wavy motions, and then as dose increases, they create more complex holistic hallucinations, such as visualizing strange or beautiful places, or seeing bizarre animals in the patterns of light among trees. It seems like each increment of dose is associated with the spread of psychedelic effects further up the hierarchy of neural processing layers producing distortions of perception at increasing levels of conceptual abstraction.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is important to understand that neurons carry out spatiotemporal processing, meaning that they analyze in time as well as in space, color, audio components, touch, etc. We have the ability to think about and represent time\u0097related concepts, such as the sequencing of events. Neuroscience research has tended to focus on rather simple temporal concepts, for example the analysis of local motion from the visual scene, or examining how animals track their body's motion through the environment. However it is highly likely that the brain computes extremely abstract spatiotemporal representations of what is happening in the world that allow us to visualize the temporal components of first or third\u0097person story narratives.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor example we are able to conceptualize walking down a garden path into a wide open field. It is the stuff of fictional writing: what is happening to you or other people as a function of time, the meaning and temporal sequencing of interpersonal interactions, and the evolving motivations of others. We can perceive these narratives, talk about them, and reason about them, and so we must have neurons which function as the building blocks of such complex temporal structures too. (I think of this is a learned perceptual representation of chunks of strong statistical correlations in the world, and not necessarily the same as making an episodic memory of a single first\u0097person life experience.)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe point of this argument is that psychedelics can progressively interfere with spatiotemporal perceptions in a dose\u0097dependent manner, leading to more and more abstract conceptual hallucinations, including generating fully\u0097formed interpersonal narratives, and this may help to explain the frequent entity encounters and personal dream\u0097like stories that people can experience. For example, using DMT on one occasion: for a number of seconds I was on a roller\u0097coaster going over a hump and down into a complex golden valley, and a woman with long flowing hair on the car in front was turning to look back at me. It was a mystical experience that was made up of a spontaneously generated and evolving abstract story line.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs a final point about the neurophysiology of the psychedelic experience, I would also mention the role of attention. A person is always shifting the focus of their attention from moment to moment, and this works like a selector, bringing into focus the most appropriate information to process next with the limited resources that we have available. The neuroscience of attention is a complex subject, but one thing is worth mentioning: attending to any perception subtly changes the neural processing applied to that information, enhancing and altering it relative to its competing neighbors. It is not surprising then that attention plays a strong role in the psychedelic experience, where choosing to attend or not attend to a thing can strongly effect the evolution of the experience. Attending to psychedelic patterns disrupts or changes the sensation, leading to other patterns. As a result, hallucinations are like quick little slippery fishes that you can never quite catch to study in detail.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is commonly stated as fact that the pineal gland of the brain synthesizes DMT and this has some effect on consciousness. This idea is really an internet meme which has taken on a life of its own with almost no supporting evidence. The idea that DMT has a natural role in the brain arose out of conjectures at various times by Andrew Weil and Rick Strassman and has been repeated again and again in popular writing and conversation as though it was scientifically established. While it is true that one study co-authored with Rick Strassman found unspecified amounts of DMT in the rat pineal gland (Barker et al., 2013), in my opinion the lack of a logical role for DMT in the body and very weak evidence of pineal gland involvement leads these ideas to have a limited appeal. The pineal gland itself, while historically viewed as the seat of the soul, is a tiny gland which is structurally simple and is scientifically established to be involved in circadian rhythm based synthesis of melatonin. Surgical removal of the pineal gland in rodents does not affect normal cognitive processing, so I suspect a concrete pineal-DMT-consciousness connection has limited merit.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA deeply complex issue is the extent to which the DMT experience can be considered 'real'. Certainly DMT produces a fairly convincing perceptual journey to other realities, as does ketamine; but the big question is whether these states are fabricated in the mind or have any objective reality. The compelling similarity of entity encounters and psychedelic experiences between individuals provides some support for the objectivity of DMT reality states. However humans also share the same brain architecture and experiential frameworks and this fact could explain the propensity for similar states during psychedelic intoxication; similar brain circuits are activated, even though the details might differ. There is also the tendency for narratives to converge as people discuss their experiences even though these narratives might have initially been quite different. Social and cultural frameworks provide a powerful regularizer on the interpretation of experiences.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn popular writing there has been a strong tendency to jump from the DMT experience as proof of other realities to theories of quantum consciousness or other esoteric mechanisms by which the brain may communicate using out-there or imaginary physics with other realms. These are all discussed as though they are proven fact and the complete lack of any supporting evidence or rational mechanisms is further encouragement for the authors to speculate ever more wildly (Strassman et al., 2008.)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn my opinion, the structure of the brain and the user's social setting and belief system can explain the experiences that people report. If you have ever tried an Oculus Rift virtual reality system you will know that surrounding a person with complete sensory signals of a place produces a compelling feeling of virtual embodiment. Both ketamine and DMT can produce states where the whole sensory system is recruited by overwhelming experiences of internally generated environments and this produces a feeling of certainty in the reality of those places. The weirdness of DMT trips is partly due to the fact that resonant modes of neural feedback are not normally experienced and so have unfamiliar properties which seem artificial and alien to the voyager. In addition, there have been studies which show that people can have entity encounter hallucinations while sober if their temporal lobes are magnetically stimulated (Booth et al., 2005), although these studies have been questioned (Grangvist et al., 2005), suggesting that activity in certain brain areas is correlated with mystical encounters.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nClearly much of the brain is involved in the processing of social interactions and representing 'other' versus 'self', and so it should not be surprising that ghost-like or alien-like presences can be experienced during psychedelic states. In a recent experiment, subjects guided a robot to touch their own back using a remote control (Blanke et al., 2014.) When a few milliseconds of delay was inserted in the system so that their actions were no longer quite immediate, they began to experience the touches as being caused by a scary apparition present in the room even though they were alone. This demonstrates how easy it is for us to perceive aspects of our experience to be caused by external beings. Another well understood example is the state of sleep paralysis where people wake up in a semi-paralyzed state due to common neurological disturbances and experience this as though a malevolent being is persecuting them. The resulting complex narratives include demonic attacks or alien encounters.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn summary, I think that because the brain is so complex we underestimate the breadth of experiences that can be spontaneously generated when its function is slightly perturbed, and we quickly jump to mystical explanations as the main cause. Having said that, science has nothing to say about the subjectivity of personal experience, and each person exists in their own universe of meaning and reality. Science can only point out that certain causes and effects are verifiably connected. Simulations of neurons such as the Google network can produce states that approximate reported psychedelic experiences. That we find these emergent behaviors in our simplistic computational networks supports the idea that DMT experiences are a mode of normal biological network processing when certain parameters of the network are altered by a pharmacological agent, without invoking new physics.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDMT is an important drug in that it provides access to extreme psychedelic states for short periods of time with relative safety. In this article I have described my own experiences and compared DMT to other psychedelics. I also have discussed many aspects of brain function that are involved in these bizarre states. We are only just beginning to understand the underlying mechanisms of conscious perception and DMT may be a useful tool to further open the door.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nReferences\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n* Barker, Borjigin, Lomnicka, and Strassman, 'LC/MS/MS analysis of the endogenous dimethyltryptamine hallucinogens, their precursors, and major metabolites in rat pineal gland microdialysate,' Biomedical Chromatography, 2013.\r<br/>\n* Booth, Koren, and Persinger, 'Increased feelings of the sensed presence and increased geomagnetic activity at the time of the experience during exposures to transcerebral weak complex magnetic fields', International Journal Neuroscience, 2005.\r<br/>\n* Blanke, Pozeg, Hara, Heydrich, and Serino et al., 'Neurological and Robot-Controlled Induction of an Apparition', Current Biology, 2014.\r<br/>\n* Grangvist, Fredrikson, Unge, Hagenfeldt, Valind, Larhammar, Larrsson, 'Sensed presence and mystical experiences are predicted by suggestibility, not by the application of transcranial weak complex magnetic fields', Neuroscience Letters, 2005.\r<br/>\n* Ray, 'Psychedelics and the Human Receptorome', PLOS ONE, 2010.\r<br/>\n* Sato, Nauhaus and Carandini, 'Traveling Waves in Visual Cortex', Neuron, 2012.\r<br/>\n* Strassman, Wojtowicz, Luna, and Frecska, 'Inner Paths to Outer Space: Journeys to Alien Worlds through Psychedelics and Other Spiritual Technologies', 2008.\r<br/>\n* Weyand, Boudreux, and Guido, 'Burst and tonic response modes in thalamic neurons during sleep and wakefulness', Journal of Neurophysiology, 2001.\r<br/>"

        "report_text": "Hello Everyone:\r\n\n\n\nI remember almost two years ago, reading how the substance DMT affects our brains, bodies, spirits, or whatever else, on this site, and many other different sites as well. DMT Hyperspace, something I never would of ever imagined to be an actuality, to be an actual reality that may very well be real. I remember laughing at a site's FAQ explaining the possibilities on how and what DMT does and/or is. I was sixteen years old then, and since then, I have experienced with psilocybin mushrooms and LSD a great number of times, and they were and still are some of the most amazing and most beautiful experiences I have ever had in my entire life. Sometimes, the most terrifying as well. It wasn't in til recently that I have obtained a large amount of DMT, I was very much excited, I had very high expectations, and have been waiting for more than two years to finally break through DMT hyperspace.\r\n\n\n\nHere is my story.\r\n\n\n\nIn the recent past and current present, I have been experimenting with large doses of DMT. I started off with lower doses at first, getting a mild DMT body high and visuals, similar to the peak of an LSD or psilocybin mushrooms trip, only lasting around 5 to 10 minutes, which sounds about right. I was getting to these levels at first with a group of friends, as so were they, but none of us ever came close to breaking into a hyperspace. I started to have my doubts, but knew that there was still more to the substance, I perhaps just hadn't perfected the technique in smoking it out of an oil burner or glass vaporizer. It wasn't in till recently when I finally perfected the process in vaporizing and smoking the substance, and reaching a hyperspace of some sort. Colors would randomly appear in front of me, merging within everything, become one. It was an amazing thing, an amazing feeling, an amazing experience like no other I thought to myself. I was getting to this place, assuming that this place was the highest level of DMT, and assuming this was the hyperspace everyone was talking about. However, I was wrong.\r\n\n\n\nThe first time... it happened. I was in my apartment, by my self, away from friends, family, all of that. I did it sitting in a pretty comfortable 'game' chair I got for Christmas one year, which was set up in my room. I was able to get around three very long big hits when it happened. It wasn't really like being shot out of a cannon into hyperspace, or anything like that, but something different. It was more, well it was in fact, a teleportation. I was teleported into an alien spaceship compartment, flying through space. I don't mean like it was kind of like an alien spaceship, or I thought it was an alien spaceship, no, it was an alien spaceship. There were not colors everywhere, or it wasn't like a travel through hyperspace, or anything that had happened to me in the past. This was so real. So detail, it was so detail in every way. It was like I was really there, in a spaceship, it was reality. I wasn't dreaming, tripping, anything like that, I was actually there.\r\n\n\n\nThe entire time I sat there, not being able to move, but just gaze in amazement, I felt a presence. I felt an alien presence above me, like they were watching me, observing me. Like they were talking to me telepathically, communicating with me through thought, trying to show me things, or perhaps they were trying to experiment with me. I was so afraid, confused, yet amazed at the same time. It seemed like I was there for almost an hour, and maybe, I was. My perception of time was out of the window, my mind was in shock. The last thing I remember while being in that spaceship, is a strong telepathic signal from one of the aliens that triggered something inside me. I was able to look down at my legs, my arms, and see my bones twisting and turning. My hair building thicker and thicker, I was turning into a monkey.\r\n\n\n\nIt was so real, I just can't stress that enough. I was totally freaking out when everything suddenly teleported back to my room, back to my reality. However though the hyperspace, though the aliens had left, I was tripping hard. Everything around my was twisting and turning, my bones would still twist and turn if I looked at them long enough. When I looked in the mirror, I looked like I was an alien. Everything was just off, and it was so intense. That lasted for at least 30 minutes or so, which eventually faded, as I laid in my bed, not being able to stop thinking, not being able to sleep. My entire body, mind, and spirit was in awe. \r\n\n\n\nThe next day, I told my room mate everything that happened, and he, like myself, were always fascinated by DMT and always joked about alien lifeforms and conspiracy theories and junk. However he was very afraid of actually going to the places that was described as the DMT hyperspace, and as much as he enjoyed reading and understanding the drug, he would not do it, he wasn't ready. After a long discussion on what I had experienced, I was actually convinced that I was contacted with a very intelligent alien life form through DMT. I had this crazy theory, like the aliens knew I had DMT, and were trying to contact me, show me things while I could see them when my third eye was activated. Crazy, right? Anyways, my friend said I should try it again tonight, and see if I have a similar experience. I concluded that I would in fact try it once again later that night.\r\n\n\n\nI did it in the same place, around the same time, with the same dose. \r\n\n\n\nBeyond Hyperspace, Time, and Life:\r\n\n\n\nEverything around me instantly began to change. It was so alien, so unbelievable. I could see energy coming up my body, telepathically communications all through in and throughout my body. Energy shifting around me, life as I know it showing me that there is so much more than the simple physical realm of fantasy I live in. I was being told instantly that aliens were in fact very real, and I knew they were now, I knew that if this is happening right now, right here, then there is no way they are not real. It was so unexplainable, so intense, so real, it was nothing I have ever heard throughout readings on internet or books about the drug. I was out of control, life was out of control. I was in the middle of another transportation, except it was so much more intense, right before my eyes I left the physical realm, I was able to look down and see once again my bones twisting and turning everywhere, my hair growing, I look up to scream, but it was too late, my head is thrown back as my spirit or brain is transformed into pure energy. I am now flowing through a network of systems, and I am one with the aliens, I am what they are, I am super intelligent, I know all the secrets of the world! BAM! Just like that, constant super intelligent information is transmitted into my brain by the aliens, who are energy like me. It all comes to me,\r\n\n\n\n'The Ultimate understanding rhythms of the human conspiracy about life\u0092s deepest concepts can be broken into by the journey to a intergalactic hyperspace of universes. Enduring into these worlds will produce realities of self-inflicted fantasies, however they are real, your body is at place while your spirit is trying to leave and show you extraordinary things. Your mind will learn what your spirit has learned, and in the end your ultimate individuality will grow as a force here on the planet Earth. Noisy sensations of parallel feelings towards distinction, triumph, and immortality like realities slam our brains from every single most exact dimensional layers according to the most advanced properties of physics.'\r\n\n\n\nThey are playing with me, laughing at me, showing me their world, explaining the many secrets of alien life, and the many secrets of the physical realm I had been living on. I knew everything, I knew that I knew it was right, I still think it might be right! I am one with everyone, I am the universe, I can produce a million words into actuality at once, and so can they. It was the most beautiful world of colors and life, fairies and aliens, ghost and angels, it was everything, it was the spiritual realm of existence, and they loved me so much. They told me so much, and they told me that I could come back whenever I wanted, and to bring as many friends as possible, because they will show them everything too.\r\n\n\n\nWhen I started to finally come back to reality, I wasn't afraid about anything anymore, I didn't question life anymore, and this is because I actually believed that I was just taught all of the secrets of the world. Right before I left the spiritual world, I was enhanced with a super charge of energy, allowing me to have the most intense mind expansion anyone had ever imagined. I could create and do anything in my mind, and see it, like it was happening. I had a rush of euphoric, more intense than the greatest LSD and mushroom euphoria put together by a million. I still was in touch with aliens, but I could not see them, not physically that is. This feeling lasted for at the least of an additional 40 to 50 minutes after the heaven I had just left. I smiled, looking down at a text from my roommate, who had been staying at his girlfriend's that week, 'Well, what happened man? How did it go? Did you see aliens again?'\r\n\n\n\nI didn't even respond. I didn't have too, because I knew that the physical realm was nothing more than a illusion, I knew that the spiritual realm, the infinite realm, was and would always be the more beautiful and more intelligent realm. I knew this, because the aliens knew this. I was filled with the greatest feeling I have ever felt, it was the greatest experience I had ever experienced, it was better than anything real, better than anything here. I then knew to myself, that I had become, addicted. Physically no, but my mental mysticism and desire was so intensely obsessed about what was going on. \r\n\n\n\nFor the remainder of the night I listened to some Trance Techno for a few hours and then I fell asleep like a baby, and remember having some very intense dreams with memories of seeing the aliens while I was asleep. When I awoke, my roommate had came back and was so curious, so concerned about what had happened. I remember his exact words, 'Dude what the hell happened last night man, look at his crazy text you sent me!' I looked at his phone, and smiled, even though I should of been freaked out. It was a text from me, that said, \r\n\n\n\n'We Have shown your friend everything he needs to know. We want you, too.'\r\n\n\n\nI didn't remember texting that at all. My friend was starting to worry and kind of freak out. What is going on man, is this really happening? Are these things really happening to you or are you messing with me? I looked down, now confused again, is this real? Do I even know what real is anymore? What is happening to me? I think I am either actually discovering the secrets of the world, or slowly slipping into insanity. Oh my. That night, I sat there, looking at it. Looking at the DMT, loaded in the pipe, ready to go. What should I do I thought? I have to get back to where I was, they told me I could go back whenever I wanted. It was decided! \r\n\n\n\nI did it in the same place, around the same time, with the same dose.\r\n\n\n\nEnergy began to flow like before, alien telepathic communications were strong, I began to look up, and close my eyes, only to be shot back into that mystical alien spaceship I was in before the hyperspace heaven. I was on one of those machines that carry stuff in like a factory, being rolled through some kind of processor data analyzer machine, seeing the aliens all around me, looking down at me, angry. They were so intimidating, angry, upset, mad at me, but I didn't know why. I wasn't in the beautiful place they had taken me before, but I was in a more physical realm, but different dimension. They were just looking at me, sucking all of the intelligence out of me that they had given me before, angry at me for some reason. I didn't know why, I didn't know what I did, I didn't understand. I was shot out the spaceship quicker than normal, and back kind of sort of to my reality, except my body was once again changing as I looked at it. My hands were complete monkey, along with big hairy arms, I felt like I was actually a monkey, and I thought I had began to scream like a monkey, Ooh Ooh, Ee Ee, Ah Ah!!!! I felt lost, I felt like part of my brain was crazy, and I was no longer super intelligent, and there was also no more strong intense euphoria like before, what had happened!?! Why?!? No!!!\r\n\n\n\nConclusion and Final Thoughts:\r\n\n\n\nAfter I was completely down, I began to really rethink reality and what has happened to me in the last week. Perhaps it was time for me to leave the substance alone for a while. I need a week or so, to settle down, think about what has happened, try and figure out what was going on. I needed help I thought, not from a doctor, I wasn't completely crazy yet, I am still in touch with my own reality, but I am very well beginning to question reality like no other time in my life. I feel as though, that I, have broken through to another level of DMT. That I have went to a level pass DMT, made contact with the other side, like they had connected to me. The things that had been happening to me were nothing like a drug. Nothing like LSD or anything like it could ever do what this has done, not even close. This substance was something else, a key, a key to our chemical structure, a key to our DNA, the key to life. I thought that I had been living in a Science-Fiction Horror movie, and that I was quite possibly on the edge of going insane. I just don't know what to think about all of this."

        "report_text": "Having a fair bit of experience with LSD and DMT, I wanted to try something new for New Years Eve. My friend and I each took 500mg of mescaline HCL which we put into gelatin capsules. Having read that mescaline causes nausea I took it with 30ml of Pepto Bismol. He took 15ml at first. We were accompanied by another friend who took 2 tabs of LSD (rated at 100ug each). My friend and I are relatively small people, about 120lbs and 5'5'. I am on 10mg of escitalopram, he isn't on any medication. The friend who took the two tabs is on 20mg of citalopram.\r\n\n\n\nEffects are noticed within the first 30 minutes. It hits about 10 minutes before my friend who took acid felt anything. As the effects build, so does the nausea. It is quite bearable, mostly an upset stomach and general discomfort. I note that the mescaline is very different from acid in terms of how it hits. It is constant and gradual. There doesn't seem to be any peaks or high points like my friend on two tabs is experiencing. He's cranked up and energetic, while my friend and I feel incredibly peaceful. I note that the mescaline is very different from acid in terms of how it hits. It is constant and gradual. There doesn't seem to be any peaks or high points like my friend on two tabs is experiencing. He's cranked up and energetic, while my friend and I feel incredibly peaceful. The visuals are fairly strong as far the visuals I've experienced on acid were like. Christmas lights outside seem brighter, everything is breathing/warping, and when I look at my carpet with flower patterns on it, it appears as though the flowers are swaying within the wind.\r\n\n\n\nThe effects continuously build in intensity. About two hours in, my nausea is gone. My friend still feels ill, and takes another 15ml of pepto bismol. Within 30 minutes he's totally fine. If I were to do this again, I think going above the recommended 30ml to something like 45ml would have been more effective. Neither of us felt all that uncomfortable though, and neither of us felt the need to vomit, so I suppose that was a happy success.\r\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that relative to LSD, mescaline does not seem to affect one's cognitive abilities nearly as much. A little focus is all that I required to have a regular conversation and appear normal. I didn't necessarily have the desire to do so, as it is much more enjoyable to be silent and take things in, but purchasing cigarettes was a far simpler matter on mescaline than when peaking on LSD.\r\n\n\n\nAt about the 3 hour mark, my friend on mescaline smokes some marijuana. I smoke a moderate amount of 5FUR144, a synthetic cannabinoid that acts like marijuana at low doses, and more like acid at high doses (synesthesia, mild hallucinations). We both begin to see tracers. The effect is quite like looking at stereoscopic 3D image that requires red and blue glasses to see. Outlines around everything are obscured by multicolored tracers.\r\n\n\n\nThis effects subside after 30 minutes or so, and we are back to the standard effects of the mescaline. A wonderful sense of calm, enhanced colors, warping of patterns, and breathing. Our friend on acid eventually leaves, and we are about 4 hours into the mescaline. Its feeling as though it is more or less leveling off, so we decide to turn things up. We each take one tab of LSD rated at 100ug each.\r\n\n\n\nWe feel the acid quickly. The calmness of the mescaline is being overridden by the speedy edginess of acid. Our visuals start getting much stronger. Color intensity is 3 times that of the mescaline alone. Mild LSD-like fractals appear in patterns on the ceiling, but to a fairly minor extent. When the heating system within the house turns on, I hear fast and beautiful guitar solos within my head. My friend of course does not hear them, it is merely my mind re-interpreting generic whirr of the rushing air as something very beautiful. The music sounds like nothing I've ever heard before. Its very fast and intricate. I'd never be able to replicate it on paper or hum it, as it is going so quickly, and I don't have the necessary musical talent to transcribe it.\r\n\n\n\nAbout an hour or so into the acid (or so I believe, we haven't been paying as much time to the clocks aside from whether or not the new year has arrived) we freebase about 50 mnother 50 mg out of 'the machine', which is effectively a glorified crack pipe with some steel wool. It did not hit anything like DMT typically does. The changeg between the two of us off of tinfoil, and then a in visuals were very, very minimal. However, the change in our headspace was drastic. The edginess of the acid was totally removed, to be replaced with the sort of single mindedness that DMT provides. The calm from the mescaline was back stronger than it was before. The next 40 minutes or so feel like a prolonged DMT trip with the mescaline/LSD hybridized visuals. This is very enjoyable, and seems to redirect the trip from a general craziness into a focused and calm direction of external information. Its hard to put into words.\r\n\n\n\nAs the effects of the DMT seem to subside, I elect to smoke a rather substantial portion of 5FUR144, and my friend smokes the last of his marijuana. He also takes a very small amount of 5FUR144.\r\n\n\n\nAt this point things get crazy.\r\n\n\n\nMy visuals immediately go into hyperdrive. The tracers come back 7 or 8 times stronger. The edges around my friend are warping along the edges of his face, flowing along his bone and muscle structure. The traces are constantly changing color, and consist of 3-4 layers in constant movement that look much like something from apocolypto, or Maori tattoos. His hair is warping and twisting, he looks very intense, with this sort of psychedelic warpaint superimposed over him.\r\n\n\n\nLooking around the room, things seem to be resembling 'mayan' or 'incan' art. I am not a religious person. I used to be a hard-line atheist, and prior to this experience I would describe myself as agnostic - open to the idea of a higher power, but absolutely opposed to any organized religious interpretation of what that power is. I've always viewed chemicals as chemicals. Mescaline was just another drug. At this point, the imagery I'm seeing my carpet get warped into, is so strikingly similar to ancient runes and designs from that region of the world I begin to have my doubts. My friend looks like some sort of ancient warrior, and the plant behind him is warping into amazing designs, that at the time seemed to be very mathematically designed.\r\n\n\n\nWe put on some white noise in the background. We both stop talking for the majority of the next 3 hours. We both are overwhelmed by sensory input and experience an amazing euphoria.\r\n\n\n\nI hear constant piano solos and other forms of incredibly intricate music within my mind. The synesthesia I experience is beautiful. I look at something with lots of color and hear more noise. I look at something simple, and the noise is greatly reduced. Everything I look at has this amazing, beautiful simplicity to it. My friend and I feel that the room we are in is perfect in every single way. As I look to my ceiling, I see incredibly intricate fractals being formed out of the material of the ceiling. I look at something simple, and the noise is greatly reduced. Everything I look at has this amazing, beautiful simplicity to it. My friend and I feel that the room we are in is perfect in every single way. As I look to my ceiling, I see incredibly intricate fractals being formed out of the material of the ceiling. \n\n\n\nThey are constantly changing, and wonderfully complex. They tessellate with one another, and are beyond virtually anything I have ever seen online. I am able to control them with my mind, and can have them form anything I imagine within my minds eye. Over the course of the three hours, I find myself contemplating things about life, humanity, god, and the universe. I feel as though I'm lost within the imagination of my childhood, and before me, my every thought is animated on the ceiling.\r\n\n\n\nThe most profound portion of this experience was when my friend and I were looking at my bookshelf. We were so overwhelmed by this incredible sense of calm, wisdom, and knowledge. It was strange, without even opening the books, we felt better. Smarter. A sense of acceptance and peace that I have never felt close to in my life. It was incredibly fulfilling and spiritual. I felt amazing. It simply cannot be put into words. I recall thinking to myself, 'This is why we have artists. To put feelings and emotions into forms that cannot be expressed by words'. I am still able to recall that calm. It is the closest I have ever had to a religious experience. It is the closest I have ever had to a religious experience. In that moment, I said to my friend 'If acid makes me feel beyond a doubt there is no god, mescaline makes me think that if he does exist, he sure loves math and fractals'.\r\n\n\n\nAfter the three hours, things went back to the standard mescaline visuals of warping and mild color intensity. We smoke 5FUR144 a few more times and get similar, though lesser in intensity experiences.\r\n\n\n\nI can honestly say this was one of the best experiences of my life. I have never expected this from any sort of drug. All in all, things lasted about 10 hours. I took a codeine/acetaminophen tablet before heading to bed and was able to fall asleep within 1-2 hours. My friend did not take one and was up for the rest of the night (about 7 hours)."

        "report_text": "My Background: Fascinated with tryptamines, dreams, and the exploration of my mind (the last two from a young age); experienced with many different psychedelics.\r\n\n\n\nPRELUDE:\r\n\n\n\nThe following write-up is a collection of most of the DMT experiences I have had over the past two years. I went through a time period where I was using DMT fairly often because I was so interested in the unique experiences it offered as a psychedelic, and I have realized now that it's best to not use it as frequently. I base this on the fact that I now have a higher tolerance than I used to, and breaking through at some points became very hit or miss (sometimes even when I took hit after hit, it's almost as if I only broke through at certain times that were 'right', regardless of how high or low the dose). My dosage at the beginning started around 20mg, and later on I started using more like 40mg (and 50mg a few times) but unfortunately I didn't record the dosage for each specific trip. I don't regret anything, as this has all been a learning process and now I have a wealth of interesting experiences to share here - it is going to be a delight to write this up (I am remembering all of these experiences based on notes in my DMT journal). This is going to be long, but feel free to just read a few if you don't have the time for all of it!\r\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND INFO:\r\n\n\n\nIt is quite a story! Some of these experiences have seemed to be continuations of previous experiences, and there are also certain 'entities' that I have encountered multiple times. I must explain that the way I look at 'entity contact' on DMT is that these entities may exist separately from us or they may exist solely within us (in this case, it would be useful to interpret these experiences in the same way we would dreams). I also think it's possible that these entities may be part of ourselves and separate at the same time; for example maybe they operate from 'microconsciousnesses' that inhabit and make up our larger, springboard consciousness that we operate from, and perhaps DMT provides us access to this type of interaction or communication. I suppose my point is that in regards to these otherworldly perceptions, I don't believe anything for sure and I keep an open mind to all of the options. When describing my experiences, I will likely refer to these entities as if they are actual beings that are separate from us, as that is the way it has often felt for me when in hyperspace. \r\n\n\n\nI hope that these experiences give the reader an idea of how diverse DMT experiences can be for one single person. My experiences have ranged from spiritually glowing to mind-boggling to disgusting and terrifying, and entities I have 'met' have had many different qualities - some have been helpful and affirming of all that I value in life, and others seemed to intend to use me for their own purposes or trick me. Even throughout the difficult times, I have remained fascinated by this compound and eager to learn all the way, and still am to this day.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nThe first time I really got a strong effect on DMT, I still felt ties to my ego and environment. I encountered three alien-like beings that were tall and slender. They weren't very detailed; they were seen mainly as silhouettes. One of them came up to me with a round seed-like object in his hands and presented it to me. It had a glowing pinpoint of light, and he seemed to be trying to get me interested in the object. During this experience, I was on the phone with my partner (D) and he was doing 5-MeO-DMT on the other end. I think that D's experience must've not been as encompassing as mine, because during my experience I heard him saying my name on the phone and this confused me a bit. I told him, 'Don't call me that.' When I turned my attention to the phone to tell him this, the entity that was offering me the object seemed to back off as if he understood, 'Oh, you're busy right now. I'll come back another time.' I remember being a little disappointed, as he dissipated right after this and I began to come down. So yeah, it was actually a pretty typical experience for DMT\u0085 and it is worth noting that at this point I purposely hadn't listened to Terence McKenna or many others describing their DMT experiences because I had heard that so many people experience similar concepts and entities\r\n\n\n\nI wanted to see if, without expectations, the same sorts of things would happen for me. After this first experience, I started reading all about the similarities across DMT experiences of various individuals. I found out that it wasn't uncommon for people to have objects bestowed upon them by entities. I was simply amazed that my experience had been a 'textbook DMT experience' regardless of the fact that I hadn't had any expectations because I hadn't read much about the specifics of others' experience.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nAfter this, intrigued, I had a couple more experiences that week. One of them was pretty much just colorful eye candy and no banter with entities - it just consisted of orange and lime beings in hula skirts, dancing Buddha-like beings, and sentiments of my dream the night before. Another time, I felt lonely and wanted to communicate with somebody but instead I found myself in a barren space that seemed to be deep underground. This space consisted only of machines and devices. They reminded me of cameras a little bit, as they seemed invasive in some sense and pointed towards me. This whole dark-ish experience seemed very vague and there was not much color. For the rest of these experiences, I will just write about what I encountered in each visit to hyperspace (separated by stars) and not so much about the circumstances under which the DMT was had, unless important.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nThere were beings all around me. They were surrounding me and had objects that seemed pointy, container-like and made of glass. These beings seemed reptilian - how cliche. They proceeded to put a viscous liquid into pointy glass containers and then put these containers in the dirt, where they burrowed into the ground. I felt that the entities were trying to tell me something about the state of the Earth. At the end, they dispersed except for one being. I  think that he was male and very young or small. He seemed lonely, but I got the impression that he was acting or not being completely honest. He told me to please not leave that realm. I communicated back that I enjoyed it there and that I also wished sometimes that I could stay, and told him that he probably somehow knew that better than I did.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nI was sitting at a desk with a bunch of colleagues (they seemed human).  This experience definitely had a business-like vibe to it. I felt accepted and happy and like I enjoyed my job. This trip was actually rather uneventful, but the interesting thing is that I sort of had a feeling like I was looking into my future. This feeling was strange in itself, because it felt like a premonition.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nI felt like I was being tested, and had more 'reptilian' feelings. I felt pretty uncomfortable, and was still in contact with this reality a little bit. My mind justified my feelings of discomfort (such as my partner D was playing some sort of first person shooter video game in the other room and I could hear disturbing noises from the game in the background). This justification was probably an auto-defense mechanism. I encountered entities again and got the feeling that the general consensus about me in the space was that even if a 'dark' or 'evil' spirit encountered me, I was so naive that I would probably find the good within it. This could be good as well as bad\u0085 Bad as in I could be taken advantage of or used as some sort of host, but the good thing was that I could make the situation 'good' and change things just from my perception alone. They seemed like they were evaluating me on something\u0085 uneasy.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nThis was quite delightful! I was in a different place entirely and it was very, very colorful. This is the only experience I can think of where I saw 'elf-like' creatures, though I didn't think of this way when I was there. I was in a multi-dimensional place that unfolded in all directions and on all sides. I couldn't tell where the ceiling, floor or walls began. There were boxes on every 'wall' lined up everywhere, and each box had a small wooden looking creature inside. Each creature had a sort of pointed hat and interchangeable body parts that could be switched with the parts of others. They were all identical in shape and form, but had different colored and textured parts. 'Souls' or energies could also transfer from one being to another. I could become part of them and they could become part of me. There was a constant 'existential narrative', most of which I can't remember.. but it was about what existence was and what the purpose was of this space and its role in existence. I remember that the narrative assured me that 'I could come back anytime I wanted'. There were so many AMAZING details that I wish I could remember of this place. At the time, I remember knowing that it was so intricate and out of this world that I wasn't sure if I'd be able to possibly remember everything at the time, which kind of devastated me because I wanted so desperately to be able to bring it back. I still took in everything that I could and it was so beautiful.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nI felt like\u0085 'Wait.. isn't there something I'm supposed to be finding out; inquiring about?' And as soon as I asked, everything exploded in my face. Everyone rushed forth, urgently giving me a message. War gears turned. Imagery of guns, bombs, war symbols, cannons, tanks and strange masked people flooded my field of vision and emotion. It was overwhelming to say the least. There was a warning\u0085 'This is imminent\u0085 this is serious\u0085' Information was disclosed unto me about the state of the world. The feeling became more and more abstract as well as terrifying and alarming. Then suddenly, I felt a feeling of LOSS unlike anything I'd ever experienced. I've never had anybody really close to me die in my life, but I felt like this right now. It felt so wrong, like something had been prematurely snatched away from me; from life. It felt so dirty and even slightly 'evil', but that sounds stupid. Profound sadness and grief. The resolution was, this really could happen. But there was good news too- I had love and I needed to appreciate what I had because who ever knew what could happen? At the end of that experience, some sort of trickster-ish entity said something to me like, 'Wait two months before visiting us again\u0085. Ha.. okay, two weeks is fine. We really *do* want you here; don't feel bad!' \u0085So bizarre.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nI had a very special trip with D and my friend, N. I could tell right away that this was going to be more intense than anything I had experienced on DMT up until that point. I slipped into a place where I lost complete contact with the waking reality as I knew it, and did not remember my surroundings or who I was at all (yet I must have still remembered my life somehow and you will soon hear why). I returned to a place that seemed very familiar. Everything that had ever happened to me was happening at once. I felt a presence of sorts, but no communication (at least not a banter). At the beginning, I felt terrified but I somehow loved it at the same time because it was just so overwhelming and RIGHT. I felt scrutinized and I knew I had to give up everything and all control in order to be alright, so I surrendered as quickly as I could. I'm glad I did, otherwise it would have probably been unbearable. I thought that I was in other places entirely. I felt specific 'era feelings' of different time periods of my life. They were SO real and had synesthetic qualities. I felt myself living in all of the places I'd ever lived in before, yet I still somehow was not in touch with my ego; it felt like a familiar dream space. It was like I was reliving every moment of my entire life at once, and this one moment was eternal. I saw bright colors that were arranged sort of like a Western blot but they were glowing and shifting and more colorful. It was like a code. It would change abruptly, like it was being operated by a light switch that had a lot of different settings. I remember one time, the 'code' turned black and white, which alarmed me somehow for a second. As I came down, I remembered my life again and realized that I was in N's bedroom and had just had some DMT, and I just felt nothing but pure bliss. I kept laughing at the sheer ridiculousness that is Life and existence, and was so wowed by the whole experience.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nOn the porch outside. The atmosphere was inspirational! This trip was kind of similar to the one I had at N's house in the way that I transcended my tethers to this reality in a similar way. The first thing that happened was I felt like I was splashed with water or had water poured all over me, drenched, and the feeling was so vivid. I also felt like there was something in my throat. (I later found out on DMT-nexus that this sensation is called the 'DMT throat marble'\u0085) I went through a sort of path.. perhaps a fabric maze, though I was sensing where I was rather than visually seeing it. I was washed in deja vu, as I remembered this exact path or process as something I had gone through before, maybe even numerous times. It didn't feel as if it had happened in a dream or psychedelic experience, but it's possible it had\u0085 not sure. I knew that I would never remember all the details as it was so complex\u0085 there were things going on and projects happening everywhere all around me, and I was a part of it. Every actual movement I made caused the colors and scene to change. If I put my physical hands out, with my eyes closed I could see the resonance it created in the 'realm'. I could feel the physical qualities of things synesthetically. When I came down, I watched reality reassemble. Everything for a bit was wispy and stringlike, blowing in the wind, as if the fabric of reality had been reduced to mere strings. It was really amazing to watch and the comedown was kind of overwhelming.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nThis next one was a vague, conceptual, non-colorful experience. I saw human forms wearing black business suits, sunglasses and hats\u0085 I got the feeling that they were doing something covert. I experienced a sort of 'video collage' of them doing all sorts of sped-up business transactions\u0085 shaking hands, driving places to get and deliver products, selling things, etc. At the very end, I saw one of the businessmen return home to his family (wife and children) and not pay very much attention to them. Apparently, he cared more about his job than his family.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nI had an experience where I felt like I was going through some sort of obstacle course. I met other *human* spirits (not sure how I could tell or what made them seem human to me, but that is what I perceived). We all had to help one another to get through the course. At the end, I felt immense gratitude and it seemed like all of the human spirits were thanking one another for their help. :)\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nThis time I did the DMT on top of LSD and 4-AcO-DiPT. I did the DMT twice during this session. (You can find the entire experience report under my name here: (http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=99864)).\r\n\n\n\nThe first experience: My friend and I were confronted (we both felt this) by some sort of strange angry presence of an entity that seemed to inhabit the room we were in. We talked about it on the way down and had experienced the exact same thing. (She'd had a lot of strange DMT experiences in this room already, actually.) To me, the spirit was angrily asking me, 'Why do all you humans ignore us? We're all around you, ALL the time, causing so much to happen, yet you credit yourselves for everything!'\u0085 I tried to communicate to the spirit that I liked sharing reality with them and that I felt that there was a lot of resonance from forces that we could not observe acting upon everything all the time. I tried to 'console the anger' of this entity. My friend and I both felt more calm and less of an angry presence around the same point in the trip, after this.\r\n\n\n\nThe next experience that night: As I tried to light the third hit of DMT, my spatial sense was so off that it took a lot of effort to figure out where to hold the lighter. It didn't help my efforts that my eyes were darting around as if I were in REM sleep mode. I looked around the room as I managed to take 2 more hits, and noticed that the room had turned into some sort of candy factory-like territory. Every piece of furniture and object in the room was static, intact and took on the exact same shape and form as it normally would, BUT each thing had its own special pattern that did not overlap with the patterns of other objects! For instance, my friend's walls (which were usually just plain white) were wallpapered in lime green and pink stripes. The plain wooden dresser was bright blue with bright pink flowers and teddy bears. I think that another piece of furniture had painted colorful candy canes on it. I was simply amazed that everything in the room could look exactly the same and be static; unmoving, yet literally looked like it was painted and wallpapered completely differently. It was so realistic and seemed like a dimension warp or something.\r\n\nAfter I closed my eyes, needless to say, things became even more interesting.\r\n\n\n\nThe place I was taken to also reminded me of a candy factory or playroom; themes from childhood were constantly present. There was a rotating gear, a sort of mandala that dominated my vision in the center of a colorful, tasty room. The gears/sections of the mandala were rhythmically changing and transforming systematically like the second hand of a clock. Every second or so (or however much time that really was), a section of it would develop into something else, and so on. Everything I saw from that point on was so incredibly detailed and rhythmic. I felt like I was a little kid in an interactive, virtual reality candy shop; this space was very synesthetic and even tasted like candy.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nOne time, I found myself in some sort of barn. I felt like I was drowning in a pile of hay or something, and I felt the presence of a horse-like entity. My visions corresponded appropriately in some sort of abstract way. At the time, I was kind of turned off by the experience because I honestly didn't really want to be there in a pile of hay\u0085 something about the experience felt 'cheesy' to me. As I was coming down, I realized that the reason I'd had this experience was because I had some things to do for work, but I'd had a lot of other things to tend to as well and had been putting off calling my boss (who reminded me and my boyfriend of a horse\u0085 and I have mentioned to several other people that he seems horselike and most people have seemed to agree).. I found the symbolism to be interesting and very reminiscent of dreams (latent and manifest content).\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nHad some DMT on top of Ketamine. This was *extremely* visual and incredibly synergistic it seemed. I noticed that the sheets on my bed switched patterns with one another (one had flowers and one was a solid blue color) and arranged themselves by color into a pinwheel with a big black hole in the middle. I felt like all the energy in the room was accordingly being sucked into the black hole, and I felt like I was going in too. I think I may have been sucked in, because suddenly things became black and void-like\u0085 but then when I emerged elsewhere, I felt a sense of grandiose importance emerge in my mind. I encountered an entity who seemed to have some sort of high status, business-wise. He asked me if I would like to take on a very important job position in hyperspace, since I was apparently 'fit for the position'. I felt so bewildered and astonished at the time.. as if I was thinking.. 'You'd *really* choose *me*?!' .. I felt like the position was something very serious and important and I didn't think it should be taken lightly. I psychically communicated to the entity that I needed a bit of time to think, as it seemed like an important position of leadership as the entity had implied. I thought about it for what seemed like a while (but was probably not actually very long), and I decided to respect the offer/position and take it. I communicated this to the entity, but then the experience dissipated.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nnext experience was very much a continuation of the last one. This time, I had DMT on top of 4-ho-MiPT. This was a very strong experience, as I completely lost touch with reality and upon coming back, was like 'Wow, I'm in *this* life! I remember this!' ..one of those experiences. Anyway, my understanding is that I met the 'boss' entity.. he seemed to be some sort of CEO in hyperspace! (Ridiculous to think about, but that is how it seemed.) He seemed all-knowing and completely ancient. He appeared to be made out of antique wood, and was covered in various compartments such as drawers, doors and windows. During this experience, I felt very honored to meet this entity. It seemed like he imparted some serious knowledge unto me about 'intent manifestation' in the waking life through dream and trance states.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nHad some DMT on top of MXE. This experience was *quite* bewildering! I instantly felt like I was punched in the face with confusion and encountered an entity before I knew it. Collided into the entity, in fact. This entity was SUPER pointy, and accordingly seemed to have spikes. Encountering it actually caused me physical pain in some way. It was orange and/or yellow, and black. It reminded me of the electric legendary bird in Pokemon, Zapdos (zap-dose.. ha). I felt like I was either zapped or stuck by a porcupine, or a mixture of both. Stunned is the best word to describe the way I felt at the time.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nThis next experience, I was still pretty grounded in reality, as in I didn't lose contact with my ego and still knew where I was\u0085 But I still experienced entity contact. I saw orange forms and felt a feminine presence. I felt a tremendous healing power from this presence and felt like I was being taken care of (I hadn't been feeling top-notch the past couple of days). The female entities were very warm and didn't seem like they wanted anything other than to help me\u0085 the most warmth I've ever felt from DMT entities. They fed me food.. it was long, and when looking back, it reminded me of intestines in its shape (but not gross or anything). I felt happy and cared for, and it seemed that the food was meant to improve my health.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\n3 big hits. I don't know where I was, but I was confronted by a mother entity. She was shapeless; dripping, melting, ugly, terrifying, disgusting, and even smelled bad. I wasn't sure what was going on, but next thing I knew, she was engaging me in psychic conversation. She had a wallet of some sort, and began showing me photographs of her son. I could tell that she loved her son very much. She also had a bunch of his artwork that she was obviously proud of, and began showing it to me. The problem was, her son AND all of his artwork were also melting, grotesque and disgusting. I could still feel her genuine love for her son and pride in his artwork, but at the same time, no matter how hard I tried to show her love, I couldn't hide the fact that I felt grossed out by her and the entire situation. I could tell that she could tell that I was feeling uncomfortable.\r\n\n\n\nWhen I came down from this trip, I found myself feeling guilty for not being able to feel/give the love that I felt that I should have given her. So I had another hit of DMT and tried to meditate on the experience and its meaning. I tried to send out my purest, most intended form of love to her and every other entity under this umbrella called consciousness. I even tried to psychically apologize to her for my reaction to her. I felt a little bit better after that, like I had resolved something.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nIn the winter one year, I made a habit of doing DMT in the shower. Sounds weird I know, but I was doing low doses mainly because I didn't want to lose complete contact with reality. This shower had beautiful tiles and strange walls with many faces in the patterns that appeared to be 'trapped spirits in rapture'. (That is the way I saw them most of the time, anyway.) I knew that it'd be a beautiful place for the trips, and I was right. Seeing the water on the tiles reminded me of a whimsical dream I'd had back in 2004 where I was in paradise. In the dream, I had been in a tiled cave with pools of all different depths, planks up in the air with flowing streams inside, bridges with streams, waterfalls, and flies. No matter where you dropped down or jumped into the water, it was okay because you would ultimately fall into deeper pool at the bottom. Seeing the water on the tiles almost instantly made me relive that dream, which has been one of my favorite dreams of all time. A divine moment of truth in a tiled cave with waterfalls all around. Not entirely breakthrough, but beautiful nonetheless.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nOne time, I got tricked pretty hardcore when doing DMT. I thought I'd put a pretty large amount in the pipe, but I must have gotten it all in the first big hit. The pipe at this point, after this hit, meant something else to me entirely- it wasn't a pipe or a lighter. I felt like it was VERY important for me to keep hitting the pipe over and over again, like it was a special mission of mine. I don't even know what I was trying to accomplish at the time.  Suddenly, it dawned on me that I'd been tricked and had spent the whole trip confused, trying to get more DMT. I felt very stupid and saw it as a metaphor to stop being such a 'DMT glutton'.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nThis next experience was after I hadn't done DMT for a while. Everything was very orange once again, and I met up with the same female healing entities that I'd encountered in a previous experience. Only this time, there were more of them. I felt their healing, caring presence strongly just like last time. We all sat in the space in peas, as if we were at a meeting of meditation to 'just be'. I felt like none of our 'stories' mattered; none of us had anything to prove about who we were, what we were trying to accomplish or anything. It was so peaceful. But then, something told me to sing. So I started singing/channeling a song from or for the spirits. They became interested and came up to me very close. One of them placed a clay jar in front of me and with every note I sang, an entity would place a small glowing (pinpoint of light) object into the jar. I think the objects were mainly lime green or yellow. I gradually transitioned back, but I kept singing the song as I came down. I recorded it on my phone so that I would never forget it. I still sing this song before doing DMT sometimes, as it helps to calm me down and sometimes I can invoke those healing entities with the song. :)\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nOne of the times where I invoked these healing spirits by singing the beautiful song I had been given, I was at my summer apartment last year. When I met up with them this time, they seemed a bit concerned about my health again (my health had gotten a bit worse and I was constantly having stomach problems). They came up to me and seemed to be offering me healing. Then, before I knew it, one of the entities extended and fused into my stomach area and seemed to actually become a part of me. As I felt nothing but benevolence from these entities, my understanding was that she wanted to be there to help me to get through difficult times ahead, because I was definitely going to need resilience. (And it's true- the past year has been one of the most difficult times of my life.. but I think I'm doing well.) After she became part of me, I felt appreciative of her presence.. but still in a bit of shock at what I'd just experienced\u0085!\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nI felt uncertain, so I started singing. By the time of this experience, things had started to get kind of muddy and I wasn't remembering my experiences very well. This trip was followed by another long break of not using DMT. What was happening had been clear in the experience, but afterwards I could only remember abstractions and not the manifest content of whatever happened. To my best understanding after the experience, I knew that I had been given something that I seemed I could 'take home' from the experience. I understood that this was *the purpose of hyperspace*, whatever that meant at the time. To take things home. I felt like I could actually bring home this physical thing that I had acquired. (I am unsure of whether I'd been given an object, or fed some sort of food. Only recently have I begun to possibly comprehend what may have happened during this experience, and I'll revisit this later in the write up.) Though I believed at first, gradually I realized that whatever I'd been given was not something that I could access any longer once I begun to get back in touch with 'reality'.  I realized that it was all a metaphor- I could instead learn a powerful tool. After I realized this, I was given some sort of schooling on this powerful tool that I could learn. I think that what happened is some entity threatened to hurt or maybe kill another entity, and I, in order to save that entity, had to sing a song. I knew exactly what to sing. I felt challenged throughout this part, obviously. I felt like I came out on top and saved the entity and passed this test. I felt happy with my abilities, but uneasy and unsure at what I had just witnessed and had held over my head. Upon coming down, I thought about how I knew that my experiences would be so much crisper and clearer and I would learn so much more from them if I used DMT less frequently\u0085 so after this, I started using DMT pretty sparingly once and for all, and to this day mainly only use it on special occasions or on top of other psychedelics.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nSmoked DMT near the end of a DPT experience (perhaps I should have had it earlier). The theme of this trip was something like, 'I could be iconic,' as in my ideas were worth circulating and if I had the motivation and intuition to put them out there, I could in fact be iconic one day. I felt that I needed to believe in myself more. At the beginning of this experience, it is also interesting to note that I saw the entire room in my field of vision turn into a mirror image of itself. The carpet that I was sitting upon on my beanbag was very colorful and I saw the carpet come to a point like it was inside a kaleidoscope. Everything had copied itself from one side of my vision and pasted itself onto the other side! I thought that this was incredibly interesting at the time and still do.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nDid DMT again while I was on DPT\u0085 This time, I saw my personal blueprint. It was mainly the colors of violet, indigo, and a bit of fuchsia. A little bit of red as well. It was roundish and seemed to emanate all that I loved or stood for in life. I immersed myself in it and felt the divine presence within my aura. I felt appreciative of everything in existence. It was a very blissful experience where I felt right at home.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nAnother time, I had DMT on top of DPT, once again at the tail end of the experience. I was transported to that extremely alien-like realm that I had been to so many times before. I felt like I was being schooled on existence. A teacher entity that seemed to have some sort of almost condescending power over me was trying to convince me that 'they' constructed our reality completely, and tried to get me to agree that this reality was not under our control; it was being constructed and predetermined by an outside force completely. Even though I had lost complete touch with reality, I did not listen blindly. I was skeptical (not that I disbelieved it, but I didn't believe it either\u0085 I always like to keep an open mind when it comes to these sorts of existential matters). The entity was SO persistent about trying to convince me! I remained neutral on the matter, but courteous and attentive all the same.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nThis next experience consisted of about 30mgs of DMT (normal dose for me) along with a few milligrams of 5-MeO-DMT and three nitrous chargers in one big balloon (so it was easier to inhale it all). I met up with a bunch of human forms (kindred souls) that reminded me of myself. I felt like I was being schooled on existence again (Existence 101 Class) and there was a teacher entity telling us that we were all meant to be intent manifestors; that we were people who were extra in touch with our intuition and spirituality, therefore we had more influence on the outcome of things than the average person. I understood that the kindred souls in the room were of varying maturities and had their own unique problems. Some were battling with issues of self-confidence, and some were egomaniacs who had realized and abused their power of influence over others. Some had found a healthy middle ground. I was told that I needed to be extra careful with my intentions and make sure to not ever abuse this special power that I had within myself. This was a very empowering trip (but don't worry; I didn't suffer any delusions of grandeur even if it sounds like I did.. ha ha).\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nThe next experience I had (quite recently) was one of my strangest DMT experiences of all time\u0085 perhaps paralleled only by my most recent one. This was with MDMA. As soon as I entered the trance state, I felt my mouth filling up with some sort of 'food' but it was textured just like dirt and even tasted like it. I felt like it was being forced into my mouth, but not in a violent way; just a little overwhelming. I instinctively accepted the food and swallowed it because I felt like it was the right thing to do. It felt like medicine of the earth (as I said, it had the same texture as dirt). I felt an intense flash of insight and knowledge after consuming this food. Perhaps it was 'food for thought'. I was reminded of how it is a personal mission of mine and theme in some of my trips that I am 'meant to bring together the world of dreams and the waking state'. This has been a literal idea of mine that I entertain, but more so, it is a metaphor to me and I feel that it means that I need to help people to be more in touch with their subconscious mind, their dreams, and their intuitions. After this, I felt a strong urge to send powerful intent to the whole universe and to all of the people in this world, for them to become more in touch with these parts of themselves in hopes of making the world a better place. With my friend, in tears, I voiced my intent. It was a profoundly beautiful moment.\r\n\n\n\n***\r\n\n\n\nThe last experience I've had to this day (very recently) almost seemed like a follow-up of the previous one. After finishing the dose (this time done after having 4-ho-MiPT), I saw something I can only describe as white, wispy, smoky ribbons materialize. These ribbons eventually gave way to what looked like some sort of folded square. It looked kind of like a package, but it looked like it was made out of clay or dough and folded a little bit like an envelope. It was sitting on a table that seemed to be in a location that reminded me of the Catholic church I had to attend in elementary school. I interacted with the entity by waving my arms in a specific way, which 'woke it up'. Then I began a banter with it. I had a complete deja vu experience where I was once again fed food (presumably by the entity), and it felt *EXTREMELY* real.. just as much as the last time. I felt the texture in my mouth; it seemed kind of cardboard-ish, wafer-ish or some similar texture (I later made a connection that this texture reminded me of the 'host' of the Holy Spirit that we were given as Communion). I was given three of them, and went through an experience that I was absolutely *certain* I'd had before (this is where that experience I wrote about earlier that was muddy where I was given or fed 'something physical to take home' comes in\u0085 perhaps this was the experience, or perhaps it was a different DMT experience that I had trouble remembering, or maybe a dream I'd had). In any case, I knew in that moment that *this was the purpose of hyperspace*; to bring back this material that I was eating! I once again instinctively swallowed it, and was fed the food three times as I mentioned.\r\n\n\n\nThe last time, I felt the food lingering in my mouth, as you do when you are chewing food and get some stuck in your mouth. I could still feel it as I was coming down, and I (stupidly, HAHA) tried to see if I could retain it and retrieve it after I came down from my trip! I realized very quickly how stupid of an idea this was, as I remembered the 'merits of metaphor' and thought to myself besides this that it was almost an insult to this great gift I had received. I stopped trying to retain some of the food and just thought to myself about the gift and how to utilize it. My friend who was with me during this experience told me that he had witnessed me doing the hand motions and dance, speaking to the entity, and then making obvious eating and swallowing motions.\r\n\n\n\nSince this last experience, I've been researching a bit about people being given food to eat during ayahuasca sessions. The closest phenomenon I have been able to find is when tribal peoples were given ' tsensak', or 'magical darts' to swallow and regurgitate during their ayahuasca experiences in order to either bewitch or heal others. I have also thought a lot about the parallels of this experience to 'the host' and 'the body of Christ' and how this experience may have been symbolic of that. I always try to entertain all possibilities and meanings, and experience great enjoyment in doing so.\r\n\n\n\nI feel that throughout all of these experiences, the most important thing I've learned is how important metaphor is (especially when it comes to manifesting one's intentions and interpreting experiences), and how important it is to keep an open mind. I already discussed my feelings and positions on entities and what they might be, and explained a bit on how I've personally interpreted my trips. I hope that you, the reader, have enjoyed this collection of experiences\u0085 because I have found experiencing DMT to be an incredible learning process\u0085 no matter *how* otherworldly the content or how difficult it may seem to integrate the bizarre into everyday reality at times, I find it to be fascinating and have some interesting dream-like value when going through the process of interpretation and integration. Hyperspace is an amazingly alien-feeling place, yet at the same time it still feels like the homiest home I have ever felt! This 'DMT space' feels like the place my soul always tends to return to\u0085 between days; between conscious thoughts; between lives. I will always have a special place in my heart for these Divine Moments of Truth. Thank you for reading, especially to anybody who actually got through all of this!!"

        "report_text": "Background: Experienced with many different psychedelics (especially tryptamines); a natural inclination towards anything psychological, spiritual or otherworldly.\r\n\nMindset: Adventurous, sleepy, good.\r\n\n\n\nThe Experience:\r\n\n\n\nI started off by drinking some mushroom tea. I had infused exactly 1 gram of what I knew to be very potent mushrooms into the water, previously boiled. I really enjoyed drinking the mushroom tea; it's always so calming and meditative for me to just sit/lay down drinking the tea and clearing my mind before the journey. It feels sacred and reminiscent of something my ancestors did - very grounding for me.\r\n\n\n\nI drank the tea slowly and when I finished it, I felt a little something already as it had been about 20 minutes. I then prepared a bowl of caapi leaves on top of weed for smoking. I went to the window and smoked these together. I smoked three bowls in succession because I knew that I needed a substantial amount of these caapi leaves  (not extract; just plain leaves) to get a decent effect and to achieve potentiation of the trip. I definitely got the potentiation I was looking for! It was a relatively quick but still somewhat gradual ascent, and the difference was very noticeable. I felt like the come-up all happened at once after the effects of the caapi hit me. I felt dreamier and more blissful, as caapi seems to help bring about this peaceful effect. My open eye visuals became particularly interesting, and I began to get a similar visual effect to many of the other times I've done mushrooms and/or DMT. This effect can be best described as something that happens when I look ahead of myself anywhere from 5 to 20 feet away. What happens is, wherever I'm looking, the empty space that my eyes are focused on develops into various shapes. It's as if the empty space appears as a type of clear plasma and then starts to get defined edges and proceeds to form into these shapes\u0085 then, the shapes break apart and the small pieces come towards me on either side.\r\n\n\n\nAs the pieces come towards me, sometimes they move in strange rigid (often symmetrical) patterns and other times they messily tumble on over. But every time this happens, the pieces are on each side, right and left, of where I was originally looking.. and they tumble over to me on either side above my head and then come down to the ground on either side of me. When they come down upon me, I can feel their energy sweep over me. Sometimes it almost feels like a light breeze. This happened countless times throughout the trip. In fact, from smoking the caapi on, I don't think this effect went away for the entire experience. Things felt very 'hyperspacey' and alien yet familiar in a similar way to the DMT space. I kept losing myself in strange trains of thought that just spiraled deeper and deeper until words could not describe under any circumstances what these concepts were. Whenever I came out of the trance a bit and attempted to extract whatever it was I had just been thinking about, the thoughts would dissipate, almost as if they weren't compatible with the conscious part of my mind.\r\n\n\n\nIn fact, sometimes the thoughts would even seem to disguise themselves as other thoughts that made more sense, but I would feel that these 'replacement thoughts' didn't come close to the complexity or meaning of the original ones. I came to call the original thoughts 'inaccessible thoughts', because usually I can't access them from my conscious mind. (These thoughts come to my mind often when using caapi, and since this experience, when using caapi other times I have been able to 'extract' a few of them by trying exceptionally hard to hold on to them and then write them down as best as I can. In this case, the thoughts have ended up translating to what seem to be premonitions of the future; various situations that seem plausible but have never actually happened - at least not yet!)\r\n\n\n\nAnyway, I kept on smoking the caapi and went into my room to trance out. I found that this level of blissfulness was hard to contain\u0085 I eagerly let go of myself and went back and forth between realities. I kept lapsing out of existence and returning 'home'. So refreshing and just\u0085 so right. There was no mistaking that this feeling was quite erotic as well, though not by a physical sense in the slightest. On the astral plane, various entities came to me and would give me advice and food for thought. Many of these issues are personal, but they had to do with various life choices, things that could or might happen in my life, and people in my life that I have met or would meet and change the course of my life forever. Although this astral plane was not by any means only inhabited by light forces (as opposed to dark ones), I will say that it felt perfectly crafted. It was exactly what it needed to be and I accepted it completely and lovingly. Because I wasn't really attached to my ego, a lot of this banter between me and entities took place through abstract communications that seemed to be of a different nature or language. However, I could still decode and understand it because it coincided with the kinds of communications that my ego self can normally understand. These communications just had to be transmitted in alternate ways since my ego self was barely present. I can't put into words what these abstract communications were, because they were just that - too abstract! \r\n\n\n\nSoon enough, I decided to put about 20mg of DMT in the pipe between the caapi leaves. This turned out to be a great idea! I felt no hesitation this time (as nearly every time before doing DMT, I become nervous even though I love it). The caapi actually made me kind of 'crave' the DMT it seemed. I have heard of this happening to others as well with caapi\u0085 The DMT just being, well, YUMMY, for lack of a better adjective\u0085 After having the DMT, I felt super trancey and wanted to close my eyes\u0085 but oddly enough, I felt that some sort of entity was telling me to keep them open. I don't know why this is. When I closed my eyes, I saw nothing\u0085 but when I kept my eyes open, the entire room was transformed and there were beings inside every piece of furniture; every 'empty' space; every wall\u0085 I could feel the personalities of each being. It was out of this world and amazing.\r\n\n\n\nSometimes the bliss would overcome me and I would start to close my eyes but then a conceptual voice or entity would alert me and tell me to keep my eyes open and pay attention to what was happening in the room. My intention of this experience had been to take in my surroundings and appreciate them, because I would be moving soon and I wanted to reflect on the times I had spent at this location\u0085 so maybe this was just a way for me to fulfill my original intention. Because this is a new house, nobody has lived in it before its current inhabitants (including me).. otherwise perhaps I would have felt the energies of previous inhabitants and relived foreign memories. I felt as if I were reliving various things that had happened in the room so far to me and others that had lived here, all of which felt vaguely familiar (because they'd taken place in my life)\u0085 but since I was an egoless being, I didn't connect them to my personal life. I felt that I was able to see them in a completely different light, free of attachments and judgements. It was undoubtedly therapeutic.\r\n\n\n\nI walked into the backyard after this and revisited the plant spirits outside. I'd had an experience a couple of weeks before where I'd taken 1.5 grams of the same mushrooms and had felt all of the plants' personalities. There was one tree that looked like a popsicle and it was pretty huge. I felt like this tree was almost condescending and didn't really like humans that much. There was another plant with jagged leaves that seemed very feminine and stylish. I picked up on an ambivalent attitude from this plant. Another tree was one in which I had climbed in the past to save my partner's cat, and he greeted me with recognition and approval.\r\n\n\n\nAll throughout this time, I kept smoking bowls with caapi and weed mixed together. Those 'empty space' visuals never went away. It seemed like this time, they were often chess-themed. There were some bowling pins included in there too, for whatever reason\u0085 There were mainly pawns and queens and horses and other chess pieces folding and breaking into pieces and coming towards me everywhere I turned. I found this to be fascinating, and if I moved my eyes in certain ways, I could control the ways in which they broke into pieces and the patterns they made on the way over to me. I liked the way it felt when they came down above my head and landed on either side of me; it felt like they were saying hello and giving me presents. The perfectly blissful feeling of exploring the hyperspace version of the territory I was usually so familiar with and appreciating everything about existence persisted for me, and I couldn't have possibly been happier to be right where I was in the moment. :)\r\n\n\n\nI went inside and loaded up another bowl of weed + caapi + DMT, and then went back outside to the side of the house and sat on a concrete block in the yard. It had been more than half an hour since the last time I had DMT, as I like to wait at least 30 minutes between DMT voyages when I'm already tripping on something else (or at all, for that matter, but I tend to only use DMT on top of other psychedelics nowadays). Because I'd already smoked a couple bowls of caapi prior to this, I got started on the bowl with the DMT right away. Like the last time, it came on very strongly with a relatively small amount\u0085 but this time, I experienced an entirely different emotional effect. Suddenly, an intense fear was struck into me. It was like one second I felt totally relaxed and blissful, and the next second I was dealing with a deep-rooted fear whose origin was unknown to me. The first thing I noticed was the ground and how I could see everything decaying and turning into other things.\r\n\n\n\nIt was as if I was concentrating on how different animals and organic materials had absorbed into the dirt and grass and decayed, and then the particles that made those up recycled themselves into other things. I felt as if I was watching this cycle of death and rebirth and became hyperaware of all of the things that had died and decomposed and then been recycled into new materials and new life in this very yard. However, the random fear seemed very urgent. It seemed like somebody was trying to tell me something important. I noticed that a certain triangular part of the grass a little bit in front of me to the left was much brighter than the rest of the yard (it wasn't actually, but that's what I saw). I understood that this triangular section of the yard was apparently a 'danger zone', and I felt that some entity was warning me that there were negative spirits there and I had to be extra careful and aware to not allow the negativity in to my own psyche. At the time, I wasn't sure what to make of this and still am not sure to this day.\r\n\n\n\nI don't necessarily believe in spirits or DMT entities as being apart from my consciousness (I don't have any beliefs when it comes to this sort of thing - I keep an open mind to all possibilities), but at the time, the fear made it seem so real to me that I tried to listen to the entity that had just communicated to me to be careful, and I stayed aware and alert so as to not let in this negative energy that was threatening me in the 'danger zone'. This fear gradually dissipated and I once again felt blessed and left with the same blissful and transcendent tryptamine feeling I'd had throughout the entire experience up until that random fearful moment. During the moments where I felt fearful, it didn't actually bother me very much. I took the fear for what it was and didn't make it into anything else; fear is just an emotion. I knew somewhere within myself that I didn't *actually* have anything to fear. I just wondered, and still do, what this meant or whether I might be able to think of any metaphorical interpretations to what I experienced in the yard.\r\n\n\n\nAfter I came down from the DMT, I was still seeing plenty of OEVs and still seeing the objects forming out of empty space and tumbling towards me. I thanked the Universe and the plant spirits for these presents! :) I decided to take a walk to the park down the street. The leaves were just beginning to change, as my favorite season, Autumn, was starting! The leaves delighted me and walking felt interesting. It was like I was hovering a few inches off the ground. When I got to the park, I passed some people and could feel all of their energies very intensely. I got the sense that most of these people didn't really look too deeply into life, which felt like a shame to me\u0085 but I supposed that everyone was just who they were meant to be all the same. It was incredibly interesting being at the park people-watching, and I felt like I could hear things and make out words being said from far away (this happens to me a lot on caapi where I experience these heightened sensory abilities).\r\n\n\n\nI felt like a fly on the wall in the distance; a spy, almost. That's how clear things were that people were saying from far away. I had begun to get very tired by this point, as it was almost 6 hours after I'd drank the tea. I sat down on a log in the park somewhere and put my head down and just tranced out in a half trippy, half sleepy state of mind. I stayed here for another 20 minutes or so, then began to walk back home. As soon as I got home, feeling refreshed from the nice afterglow, I jumped into bed and fell into a deeper-than-usual sleep rather quickly.\r\n\n\n\nBecause caapi is a RIMA MAOI and doesn't last very long, and on top of that, my route of administration was smoking, I experienced no negative side effects such as nausea or stomach discomfort and did not have to watch my diet. I felt that the caapi made the mushroom trip MUCH more visual than I'd ever experienced mushrooms to be before, and I felt much more spiritually ecstatic than usual throughout the entire experience. I also felt much more dreamlike. Smoked caapi seems to work wonders with mushrooms and DMT; Terence McKenna was definitely onto something when he suggested smoking caapi leaves on top of mushrooms. I'm going to have to explore this combination furthermore!"

        "report_text": "Hello, my name is Donovan and this will be my first report regarding experiences of a psychedelic nature. Just to provide a little background regarding myself and the circumstances surrounding my encounter I will tell you that I am what some would call a very \u0093spiritual\u0094 personality. My brother, Boob we call him, and I have been on a rollercoaster ride of fantastical advancements since we read \u0093The Celestine Prophecy\u0094 in 1999. He, Boob I mean, leans a little more toward the theoretical side of our sojourn while I like to dive right into the more practical areas, which of course includes the use of psychedelic substances for the exploration of the psychological aspects of our perception. I had always been primarily interested in altered states of consciousness due to their ability to so brazenly expose one to their deepest illusions and most precarious understandings, and I had experimented with LSD and psilocybin as well as many of the more conventional substances such as marijuana and alcohol for quite some time to little avail. I found that THC helped to enhance my attention span and enthusiasm towards hobbies such as writing and playing video games, while the relaxing effects of alcohol allowed for me to be much more outgoing in social environments and to stop hiding my true nature from others. Hallucinogens provided a much needed and awe-inspiring vacation from the monotony of everyday life but had never left me with any truly groundbreaking insights into the nature of reality aside from revealing how dynamic and \u0093liquid\u0094 my perception of it could actually become. I had thought that my aforementioned forays into the lesser known world would have prepared me for some of the more powerful experiences available to the human psyche but upon testing salvia for the first time I was made briskly aware of how deeply wrong I was. What happened in that instance would change my life forever, but that is a story for another time. In this submission I would like to make an attempt at illustrating as best I can the sheer craziness that is the DMT trip.\r\n\n\n\nAfter trying salvia a few times before reaching what I like to think of as the \u0093bottom of the universal mystery\u0094 I became very frightened of that encounter with what seemed to be the \u0093real world\u0094, if such a place exists. However, I was still very enticed by the idea of returning, only under more manageable circumstances. With salvia I could  not even ascertain a method of fighting to remain myself let alone negotiate the great void to which I been introduced, and I was hoping to find an \u0093easier\u0094 way to get \u0093out there\u0094. Meditation works to some extent, but could never take me so far so fast or in such a tangible and observable manner. At the same time no other narcotics could compare to the all-consuming effects of that simple little plant. I was in a fix to be sure. After spending the past couple of years dealing with severe family-related financial problems, having little to no time or aspiration for uncovering deeper levels of understanding I felt stunted and stifled in my quest for personal evolution. When we stumbled upon accounts of DMT and Ayahuasca induced adventures relating encounters with entities existing in a realm that seems \u0093realer\u0094 than this one I felt that we had encountered providence, as we just so happened to know someone who actually had some DMT for sale at the time. As soon as Boob and I got back from work with our pay in pocket I purchased myself a one way ticket to \u0093elsewhere\u0094 thinking that if I could handle salvia at full force then surely I would be capable of piloting the DMT vehicle without difficulty. Yet again, I would find myself deeply humbled.\r\n\n\n\nIn order to relate my experience for what it truly was I must first elucidate my state of mind in regard to the occasion. Throughout the course of my spiritual and psychological training I have become deeply obsessed with the concept of an existing \u0093God figure\u0094 in the universe. Now before you jump to any conclusions let me state that my fascination has absolutely nothing to do with any religious study or kinship, in fact, though I believe that some ideas related in the Bible and other such religious texts are especially relevant to my personal understanding, I do not, never have, and never will prescribe to any one religion and maintain my personal opinion that devotion to any religion destroys one\u0092s ability to comprehend a true God to some extent if not completely. The God figure that I speak of is simply the infinite mystery of existence. Where did we come from? Where are we going? What is our absolute situation, our ultimate truth? What is really happening here? The God that I seek is simply an ultimate comprehension of who I really am beneath the manufactured illusions of an inescapably superficial reality. The self-proclaimed realizations that I had made during my encounters with salvia were particularly frightening to me and of course these would inevitably colour my experience with DMT. I intended only to maneuver deeper into this bizarre void of consciousness in the hope that some greater sanctity might be revealed thereat, and though I cannot be certain of the validity of my conclusions regarding the event, I do believe that just such an occurrence has transpired.\r\n\n\n\nAnyways, when I went to pick up the brown sugar-like pebbles from my buddy down the street he offered me some magic mushrooms that he had left over from a little while back along with it and I figured that one couldn\u0092t go wrong with a price as cheap as free, another friend of mine had left my brother and I a couple bottles of wine that he had procured from the warehouse in which he works as a celebratory gift for me having recently acquired employment involving restorative carpentry with Boob in an impossible economic environment, and we already had some extremely beautiful weed to smoke, so I was sure that this would be a weekend to remember. I have a severely addictive personality and tend to overdo things as often as is possible. I rarely ever really regret this behavior, but boy was I in for it this time. I decided that since we had just finished a long and arduous week of woodworking and we were already tuckered out for the night that I would save the mushrooms and wine for the next day when we were well-rested and did not have to work in the morning, but I just could not will myself to wait on the DMT. I had already been waiting long enough.\r\n\n\n\nFor the price of just ten dollars I obtained a plastic vial containing seven rocks resembling amber but smelling very similar to old dust in the attic of my childhood home, each of which would be sufficient to propel an individual into the cosmos. Of course, having no grasp for the gravity of the drug that I was about to abuse I asked Boob for a small nugget to pack as a filter and then proceeded to cover it with three stones smashed into powder. \u0093Here we go!\u0094 I say confidently to my dear brother as I set the flame the pipe and pulled. I had intended to hold the hit in as long as possible for maximum effect but almost immediately found myself scrambling to get the smoke out before it all became too intense to endure.\r\n\n\n\nAs soon as the smoke entered my lungs I witnessed the objects around me tear apart from their halos, leaving neon streaks of electromagnetism hanging in the air around them which stuck in place and then shrank as though being pulled by expansion into the vastness of space. At this point I remembered it, not from any experiential account that I can recall per se, but more from a primal, instinctive perspective. I \u0093knew\u0094 what was happening, and all I that could say before collapsing on the floor was, \u0093Ohhhhh...\u0094 The sound of my voice droned out into the rapidly shuffling distance as a wave of electrical vapor swelled into a tsunami that came flooding in from the right of me, and all that I could do to keep from being swallowed was drop onto my back and close my eyes in an attempt to escape the chaos that was suddenly ensuing all around me. I witnessed then, without eyes to see, the ceiling and walls of the room transform and inflate with a weightless force into an enormous dome of prisms resembling diamond eyeballs peering in at me from the edge of the world while radiating rainbow coronas in every direction. It was as though the living room had become this great museum of spectacles that had always been there just beyond my ability to perceive and had now been revealed, ephemerally, for me to partake of. I felt that though I could observe the museum from a singular point within the museum that somehow I, at the same time, am the museum. I wanted ever so desperately to exacerbate how amazing it was in vivid detail but all that I could manage was, \u0093I can\u0092t fraking explain it... I don\u0092t even know what to do with myself here...\u0094 That was when the shifting began.\r\n\n\n\nSuddenly everything was tumbling and folding into itself, much like what I have experienced with salvia in the past, however, the difference is that this time I was still me and was able to see what was actually happening. The gravity was shifting, but not without deliberation. The very rules that make up the game of life were being rapidly changed ever so slightly by some alien persona very concisely, as though the function of the existential machine depended upon the shuffling of these values. When I use the term \u0093alien\u0094 I do not mean extraterrestrial, I mean truly alien, inconceivable. Something entirely unknowable. Again, this conception is totally congruent with my experience of salvia, however, again, this time I can actually maneuver, and so I move toward the edge of the dome where I find a strange man standing in the corner manipulating pulleys and levers as though he was running the stage arrangement for some grand play. He works the mechanisms in the corner while turning his gaze around to me, smiling wildly. He looks eerily similar to Two-Face from Batman, and even appears two-dimensional, like a comic-book character. I think of him as being the museum\u0092s curator. I can remember thinking, \u0093This guy\u0092s obnoxious.\u0094 before making my way back to the museum showroom in the center of the dome. \r\n\n\n\nUpon reaching said area I found myself standing in the living room again, effervescent clouds of color streaming from the walls into the vastness surrounding like a cacophony of vacuums oscillating infinitely. I could then just begin to hear disjointed ramblings approaching. It was a myriad of sounds collecting into small bunches that made up little symphonies. Each one was a different genre of music entirely and sounded quite discordant uniquely, but altogether the differing music created a larger orchestra and I could just barely make out the melody. The song was beautiful beyond words, yet still, I could not stand the madness. The rules were continuing to shift, the gravity continuing to fold, and I feared, yet again, that I would be lost forever. Looking over towards the couch I see Boob sitting straight up with his eyes fixed on me, and for the first time since the initial puff I can feel my own eyes and how wide they are. I must have appeared positively frightening at the time. When I see him I get the feeling that I am viewing a mirror of some kind and I am relieved that he is present. My exact thoughts were, \u0093I\u0092m cool, that\u0092s Boob right there. That\u0092s Boob? I\u0092m Boob! I\u0092m Boob? I\u0092m not Boob. Have I been Boob this whole time?\u0094 and all of a sudden I am someone else. I have been the entire time. \u0093Then who is Donovan?\u0094 I wondered. The riddle was humongous and encompassing. Everyone that I knew was in the room at this point, all going about separate businesses, I just couldn\u0092t see them if I tried to look. I could feel them though, because I was them! \u0093Residual memory.\u0094 I told myself, but I was my brother, so who was me? The rules continued to fluctuate, not immensely, but just enough to keep us all confused. The curator continues to meddle obnoxiously, but not without reason. I reach to my left and feel the leg of the coffee table.\r\n\n\n\nSuddenly I am back in the living room again. Boob notices the change in my demeanor and asks me if I\u0092ve returned. \u0093I think so\u0094 is all that I can honestly tell him. There is still a very conceivable current of electricity snaking its way throughout the room, but for all intents and purposes I am me again, and I am lucid. I tell Boob that I think I have to vomit and begin walking into the bathroom. Immediately upon entering I recognize a strong feeling of nostalgia sweeping over me like excessive d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I said to myself, \u0093I\u0092ve been here before\u0094 and for whatever reason it seemed so very sad and desperate, as if I\u0092d been there forever. The area repeatedly assembled itself in patterns befitting its character and I felt as though I was standing backstage at the show of all things, alone. After attempting to gag myself into vomiting a few times in hopes of relieving myself somewhat I looked into the mirror and saw that I was me, truly, not some other person, and suddenly I sobered. I walk into the living room and smoke a cigarette while trying to accurately relate my experience to Boob. \r\n\n\n\nThe next morning we ate the mushrooms with the intention of playing a two-player role-playing game while tripping. No more than a half an hour in and I was no longer cognitive. I had absolutely no idea what we were doing or what in the hell the point of any of it was, so I stopped playing and we began to watch a television show. Immediately I recognized the embossed quality of the picture from the last time I had ingested psilocybin whereat myself and a good friend of mine sat here all night laughing hysterically at a British television show about survivors of an Earthly holocaust rebuilding humanity on a barren planet, and I suspected that I would experience the same type of trip as then, mild and unproductive. I was wrong. Within an hour or so the entire room had taken on this very distant quality, like the walls of an aquarium, right there, yet so far a way, and the objects in my environment were floating on a tide as though the ocean has swept into the room and overtaken things. The cat was being a grouch in the corner and I was finding this all very amusing and enthusing until...\r\n\n\n\nI find myself awakening to the realization that Boob and I had been sitting here doing all of this together for ages, forever even. It was like we were the first two people in the Garden of Eden waiting throughout eternity for each other to wake up from this crazy dream that we\u0092ve been having. I felt as though he knew every intimate detail of my life, and in this nakedness I felt ashamed and scared. I felt as though I needed to retreat. I couldn\u0092t bring myself to embrace the extreme unity of this relationship. I could not face this reconciliation, yet. I had to run away and hide in waiting. I felt so stupid that I had been doing this for so long. The whole world knew as well. Everyone that had ever been was pointing and laughing at me because I created this insane illusion to hide myself from my closest friend. A voice is telling me to get up. At first it seems like a motivator telling me to get up and make a better life for myself, create a better me, but then it begins to twist and turn, seeming more like a first-responder finding my body on the ground and begging me to be alright. I begin to think that maybe I really have been in some horrible accident and this is someone trying to revive me. \u0093Get up! You have to get up!\u0094 I open my eyes to find that it is indeed a person speaking to an unconscious body, on the television. \u0093Damn, that was freaky.\u0094 I tell Boob who is hiding under a blanket on the couch. We both come to and decide to take another shot at playing the video game.\r\n\n\n\nWe run our characters in circles and stare at the clouds laughing and exclaiming how very awesome everything looks for about fifteen minutes before throwing our controllers to the floor and laughing at them as well. I feel as if I am at the peak of something now, just close enough to reach higher, and so I suggest taking another hit of the DMT. Of course my brother isn\u0092t into it (I think he\u0092s afraid), but I don\u0092t let that deter me and I take a hit of what remains in the pipe from yesterday. It greatly enhances the trip but does little else, nothing worth mentioning here at least. Later on that night I take another hit with a very good friend of mine who cannot partake of other drugs due to enforced legal parameters, and we got high together, that was about the gist of it. It was a very fun night, but nothing exceptional beyond what I\u0092ve already mentioned.\r\n\n\n\nAt any rate, disappointed with not having returned to the fantastic museum the night before I waited until early in the morning the next day to try one last time, as our resources had grown slim and my brother hadn\u0092t taken his chance yet. I could remember distinctly having felt as though I were fighting the trip the first time and that I needed to relax in order to experience it fully. It just so happened that the wine had been left over from the first night and all seemed to be perfectly aligned. I drank the wine slowly as I watched videos on the internet of people relating their own experiences with the drug in order to build myself up to the moment. It was an extremely beautiful young lady that described, to the best of her abilities, having seen angels in her visions that finally pushed me over the edge, and I packed up probably a little more than I should have. I took a long, slow drag of the pipe and immediately I recognized having made the same mistake again.\r\n\n\n\nNow, I cannot fully remember what happened here as of yet, but I can tell you that I was scared beyond my wits upon awakening from it. I recall having become a two-dimensional black and white zigzag pattern and remaining that way for quite some time. I felt as though others were watching from somewhere, though from where I could not tell, as I was existing in a two-dimensional universe. I remember a gigantic face, somewhere. A woman\u0092s face, made of rainbow colors. She was watching me, and it seemed as though she had always been watching me but I simply had not noticed until now. Though she seemed complacent, I felt as though she was happy that I had recognized her. During the episode I lost consciousness at some point and had very vivid dreams wherein my brother failed to relate to me his experiences with DMT several times over the course of a full week\u0092s worth of time, even though he had not even really tried it yet, after which I awakened to my brother getting up very early in the morning which led me to believe that I had skipped a day and that we had to go to work immediately, which scared me quite a bit. All in all, it was a seemingly eventless experience, but I feel that the insights are apparent, and I am extremely grateful to have been a part of it. Until next time..."

        "report_text": "Background  \r\n\n\n\nI am a 19-year old male with a full-tuition scholarship to an SEC university where I major in Biology and Spanish.  I am a Pre-medicine student with 79 completed hours and a GPA of 3.67.  I was also a top-tier student in high school; I scored a 31 on the ACT, including a perfect 36 on the reading section.  I had stayed away from drugs in high school, except drinking on rare occasions.  I joined a fraternity my freshman year, which came with the weekly binge drinking associated with Greek life.  I began to smoke weed occasionally, which is practiced less in fraternity life, but is prevalent in almost every chapter on campus.  By Spring Break of my freshman year, I was smoking almost every day with my fraternity brothers.  I decided I was going to try psychedelics when summer began.  In the year since then, I have sampled a plethora of psychedelic drugs, including: mushrooms, morning glory seeds, mescaline, ecstasy, LSD, and DMT.  I smoked DMT twice in the summer of 2011.  I will describe in detail the experience I had the second time I smoked DMT.\r\n\n\n\nExperience  \r\n\n\n\nMy friend Kaz told me he had acquired enough DMT for three people to trip.  So the next day, we drove down to my roommate Warren\u0092s lake house to smoke it.  Kaz split the yellow-orange crystals into three piles about the size of a nickel.  Kaz and Warren had their own bowls to smoke the DMT; I did not have my own piece, so I decided I would smoke out of an old bong that Kaz had brought along.  Kaz packed up all three pieces with DMT under a layer of kush, and we went outside to trip.  Warren suggested that we go out on the lake in his canoe to smoke the DMT.  I thought it was a good idea, but Kaz said it was too dangerous.  We decided we would smoke under Warren\u0092s deck; this decision probably saved all three of our lives.  We sat in lawn chairs with our pieces ready to go, and played some Pretty Lights on Warren\u0092s phone to trip to.  I had smoked DMT once before, but I had not \u0093broken through\u0094, so I decided I was going to take as big of a hit as I could this time.  \r\n\n\n\nI put the flame on the bowl and drew in slowly, to avoid torching the DMT, for as long as I could.  I exhaled and took a quick glance at the bong filled with thick DMT smoke.  I inhaled sharply and sucked every last bit of the smoke deep into my lungs.  I held the smoke in for about 7 seconds before exhaling, and I was already tripping harder than I ever had before.  Everything in my vision became so vibrant that it surpassed my understanding of what a color is.  I tried to remember, but it was already too distant a memory to recall in my current state of mind.  \r\n\n\n\nI think I closed my eyes, but I will never be sure.  I felt a voice say, \u0093Come with me\u0094, and I went.   I instantly lost connection with everything I had ever experienced since my birth.  I could not even think in my own language or remember anything at all about my past.  I broke into a state of consciousness without the perceptive lens of being myself, or a human, or even a living organism.  I not only felt dissociated from my body, I was separated from my soul.  I experienced an eternity in an instant.  I had blasted into oblivion, free of any shred of conscious thought.  I think I was in ego-death for about ten or fifteen minutes of human time.  \r\n\n\n\nComing back to the concept of having a body, I thought I was lying dead in the street in the presence of my mother and an ambulance crew.  Then Kaz said, \u0093Guys, we just blasted the fuck off.\u0094  I remembered that I had smoked DMT, and came most of the way back to reality.  The rest of the five or ten minutes of the experience was just normal visuals and feelings that come from an average dose of LSD.\r\n\n\n\nReflection  \r\n\n\n\nThe extreme intensity of this trip definitely came from the method of ingestion.  Smoking the DMT out of the bong allowed me take a much bigger hit deeper into my lungs and hold the smoke in longer than is possible with a bowl.  DMT tastes absolutely terrible, but I was tripping too hard before my first breath after the hit to comprehend taste.  The total loss of connection with my ego shattered everything I had previously believed about the relationship of the human body and the soul.  I had been a Christian and fully believed that my soul, in the sense of my personality and memories, would pass into the after-life.  \r\n\n\n\nUpon returning from ego-death, I immediately dropped the idea that the soul remains intact after the death of the body.  I now believe that what people think of as their soul is actually only their perceived separation of their consciousness from their body.  I now think of everything much more objectively, rather than from the limited perspective of a human.  I used to think of God as being very close to the deity described in the Bible. Now I believe that God is the everlasting and unwavering laws of the Universe, such as gravity and intermolecular forces.  \r\n\n\n\nThis DMT trip was much more intense than what I was prepared for, or even thought was possible from psychedelic drugs.  Since this experience, I have had a few serious after-effects that I believe result directly from tripping so hard on DMT.  Multiple times when I have gotten strong head-rushes, I feel extremely spaced out similar to the feeling of the onset of DMT, and I even taste DMT in my mouth.  If I let my head hang back over the edge of a chair, my vision goes black and then immediately returns accompanied by intense hallucinations. One time I was hanging on a ladder at the top of a staircase at my frat house to loosen my back, and went into a crazy trance.  The next thing I knew I was lying at the bottom of the flight of six stairs looking up at Warren standing at the top.  The alarming thing was that I had not just passed out and fallen down the steps.  My eyes had been open and I had actually watched as I fell all the way down the steps, I just had been tripping too hard to realize I was in a dangerous situation.  \r\n\n\n\nI do not recommend that anyone use DMT or other extreme doses of psychedelics unless they are prepared for the possible intense mental consequences that are an inherent risk of psychedelic drug use.  Although I consider my DMT trip to be the most important experience of my life, I would never even consider doing it again."

        "report_text": "As a casual tripper, mushrooms and phenethylamines were definitely otherworldly and revealing of my soul... but I never knew such a thing as THIS would ever be possible. I am talking about my introduction to n,n-Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT. My one and only.\r\n\n\n\nFor my experience I was at a friend's house, dimly lit by small windows above my head and out of site. The only light was from the fading evening, and the sparkle of objects around me. I turn on Eyes of the World by the Grateful Dead, a 16 minute long version with saxophone and extended jam. I am seated on a comfortable couch and had been smoking a lot of cannabis in the form of blunts and also in bowls for hours leading up to the experience. I was actually feeling only slightly 'burnt out', coming down and quite sober (for a long-term marijuana smoker).\r\n\n\n\nMy friend Henry walks over and hands me a 'crack pipe' (a glass tube with Brillo/foil on the end) loaded with what he called 'a big hit' of n,n-DMT. I had just watch him launch off on his own journey... it looked strange. He had closed his eyes and felt around through the air, making strange humming noises occasionally like he was seeing something else. I knew it would be intense.\r\n\n\n\nI take the hit. It is my first time, and I know little of what to expect. Read on..\r\n\n\n\nImmediately after exhaling I raise my head and the room is vibrating very quickly, and this is quite visible on objects. Things begin to change depth wildly and quickly patterns begin to unfold over objects. The accelerating continues despite this and soon the room is getting difficult to recognize. My thoughts suddenly break contact with the outside world and understanding is severely crippled. Eyes close, almost involuntarily.\r\n\n\n\nSuddenly, I am immersed in the most dense, intense, unprepared voyage of my entire life.\r\n\n\n\nI quickly forced my eyes open as around the room my cousin and friend are trying to talk to me. Their words are becoming intermixed and suddenly the words don't match their mouths. I instead am incredibly fixated on their facial expressions, and suddenly I can read their thoughts. 'He's really getting into it now,' one said, and no longer can I keep my head up.\r\n\n\n\nThe room around me looked like a painting made by Michaelangelo. A TV near the top of the room (which was off) turned into a heavenly mirror, and all the objects seemed to be sort of arranged around it like a god had set it up. It seemed to be too perfect. The objects were raising up to it, in a formation...\r\n\n\n\nThe visuals were getting too strange, nearly if not disturbing. I say something along the lines of 'It's like an instant psychosis,' to which my much older friend replies, 'In a way... yeah.' I become nearly nauseous from the speed of the experience and put my head down on my lap. But for some reason I can still see the room I was in, exactly what I was just looking at, but just shadows of the people and objects that were being overcome by patterns like cogs turning in a machine. Everything kept moving like I kept my eyes open,but soon even this begins to fade out, seemingly into black.\r\n\n\n\nThe last thing I hear is, clearly from my cousin, 'WOW. Well I wonder how deep this can go..'\r\n\n\n\nAND THEN - There is no longer James, a human/primate born of K and J and at a friend's house doing a drug. What is a drug anyway? How can such a term even begin to describe the true being, the otherworldly void? This can't be a drug. This is life. Society, understanding, values, morals, distant and distinct memories, my role, my status, any predispositions - GONE. \r\n\n\n\nScenes like a slideshow begin appearing, just as realistic as the room around me looks now. The scene formed and then panned in the direction of right, over the most detailed, alive, and REAL metaphysical pictures I have ever seen. No artist can comprehend this, no human brain should even be able to contain this amount of information. It is absolutely INSANE to think about.\r\n\n\n\nBut it goes even further then that. Soon, the scene in front of me dives in, and any visible hallucinations are lost. What is left is an extremely white, bright, shimmering light. Like I was in the largest, most surreal and beautiful but empty room ever. I had stopped feeling a body a long time ago. I was no longer in a body, I couldn't comprehend what a body is or where I came from. Even what I was, or how I am. The only thing left was what I consider... my soul.\r\n\n\n\nJust a single point of consciousness in the REAL, the TRUE sea of  creation. I had returned home to pure being, and my past life - the whole lived out illusion - is all simply a very strange, coincidental occurrence. That is not the true self, for the true self is ultimately part of something much larger, more vast, and all-including. Every single sensory thought or experience, all merged into one, giant, never-ending cosmic entity. Soon this panned out, and I began seeing the universe. But it wasn't just a universe, it was a multitude of universes - THE multi-verse. A large, almost writhing, with constant shifting and movement to and from different universes/points of reference.\r\n\n\n\nAny possibilities, occurrences, past and future, and right now, was all going on simultaneously in front of me. I began to see hundreds of different individual's points of view, out of their eyes; people I know, friends, relatives, and people I'd like to know. Suddenly I realized that I was ALIVE... the points of view I was looking at of had to be something I knew, and I immediately was certain I was seeing what other people were seeing at that exact moment. I remember a friend who's point of view I looked out of specifically.\r\n\n\n\nGone are the oddities of why we are here, how, and what our purpose is. We are all manifests of the same godly single conscience and I truly saw my life for what it was... a cell, on a leaf, on a stick, on a larger stick, on a branch, on a larger branch, connected to the biggest redwood in the largest, never-ending forest that ever existed. Suddenly everything feels perfect, pure, awe-inspiring, truly completing. I am nothing, yet everything all at once. Even the multi-verse was gone now, and visions of the future too. It was just me.\r\n\n\n\nMy life is meaningless, but at the same time - truly beautiful to be able to behold, like I received the once-in-a-lifetime chance of being granted outside consciousness to see all of thisand appreciate it from another point of view. Upon death, I will return to what I was before - a true wave in the continuous sea of existence. 'Til then, I have been granted the opportunity so far to enjoy all of this as a part of the intelligent, understanding life here, in the second millenium of the 'current era.' We are all yet another facet of the same all-including, infinite entity in it's constantly continuing, simple EXPERIENCE.\r\n\n\n\nI probably began coming down when I realized I was alive again... I noticed an extremely clean and pure feeling, and realized it must've been AIR. FRESH, beautiful air, going in and out of my system. I still didn't feel my body, but I knew I had to be breathing.. something. Oh WAIT, I do breathe. And its fucking WONDERFUL. Absolutely perfect actually. But that would mean...\r\n\n\n\nWithin a period of 5-10 seconds, the white light suddenly became the room around me. Even with eyes closed, I saw the room taking shape, when I opened them finally, my vision was SURREAL and FULL OF LIFE.\r\n\n\n\nI IMMEDIATELY stood up, could hardly walk for a second. 'This is PERFECT!' I immediately exclaimed. For some reason, I read my cousin and my friend's mind immediately. They were worried about how long my trip was taking, as I had to be heading home pretty soon. I had been completely immobile for nearly 10 minutes. They began to ask me if it was good and I said 'YES!'... not yeah, yep, etc. But the most pronounced and almost too intellectual 'YES!' like you might hear someone say who has studied English very hard but just isn't familiar with speaking it.\r\n\n\n\nThe absolute strongest and most life-changing experience I've ever encountered and could ever imagine encountering. I had completely changed the process of my brain within 10 minutes time... and I LOVED it. I walked over to the TV and grabbed my iPod literally RIGHT after I stood up and simultaneously knew I had to be leaving soon. My cousin and friend were SHOCKED at how much I had gotten out of it and we immediately began to walk outside. \r\n\n\n\nThere wasn't even really much to say about it. As I began getting in the car, suddenly I was overcome with thirst. Like I hadn't had water in hours. I wasted no time saying 'I'm going to need to get some water,' and my friend started saying he had locked the house already. He asked if I'd like to get some water from the hose, and laughing with the most wonderful of joy and ecstasy in life, ran with him all the way over to his water hose like a man on a mission. I took sips out of it and despite the water being public water and most likely disgusting, it was the most cleansing and pure tasting drink I had ever experienced.\r\n\n\n\nIt was then that I realized just how much my vision was still affected by it, there was a paradigm shift in how I viewed the world around me that marked the drug leaving my system but leaving its mark on me for good. For about the next hour or so I felt what I wouldn't even call a high... I was LIVING. And it couldn't get any better.\r\n\n\n\nI got dropped off at my cousin's house to get picked up (my car was broken). He asked if I would be okay talking to my aunt if I had to, to which I responded 'It was never a problem.' I did indeed have to talk to my aunt who noticed a car pulled up... I'm sure she thought I was under the influence but I don't think I have ever been so kind and carefree sounding when having small talk. I told her I would not need to go inside as I would be leaving very soon, and she walked in with a smile on her face that I almost knew recognized that I was tripping.\r\n\n\n\nI went home and don't even really remember anything of what ensued... I assume I fell asleep nearly immediately upon arriving there. I awoke the next morning on a Saturday, and could still feel the beauty nearly as strong as when I was talking to my aunt the day before. I quickly was inspired and ran to my printer, pulling out a large sheet of paper. I had so much to convey, and began drawing. I drew what is one of the best pictures I have ever created, and used shading/techniques/creativity that I had NEVER known was possible. It looked like what one might see from an art student, not an occasional doodler. And it was perfect.\r\n\n\n\nThis experience still is my strongest to date, and I do not regret it. I was quite young but mentally, was never really my age anyway. I believe after this experience that I became a lot more self-aware... I seemed more 'here'... like I was actually open to millions of new things around me that before I had noticed but didn't think was important. \r\n\n\n\nI saw God, and me in everything, and still do. I began witnessing how interaction between the infinite multi-verse comes together to create the reality we know and live in day by day. Events to this day are still filled with magic, inspiration, and purpose. I get what is going on around me, but also noticed that I lost interest in trying to find out 'more'. I didn't and still do not think there is much 'more' for me to discover through psychedelics, although I do enjoy phenethylamines with friends on an extremely rare occasion. I however, do not take 'high doses' or even really 'moderate' doses anymore of ANYTHING. I have no desire to do DMT ever again, or even really 'trip' on ANYTHING as much as just have a good time every few months on low dosages.\r\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if I ever had a desire to do it, but I did do it. And I would never have had it any other way. I realized that drugs were not of much importance to me, and that I spend far too much time smoking marijuana and not enough exploring just how much is around me in this world.\r\n\n\n\nMany thanks for reading this far, and may you have health and good fortune in your entire life and all of your enterprises. If ANYTHING one might find negative came out of this, is that I don't enjoy doing most drugs at all anymore and even get some negative effects that I would NEVER get before when I try to abuse them hard. \r\n\n\n\nThis however is WONDERFUL for me, as I don't think that is my purpose... I don't think I was ever meant to abuse drugs. It didn't stop me smoking marijuana, in fact I probably increased my marijuana usage after that. But it sure cut me down to size just about everywhere else.\r\n\n\n\nUntil next time, on the other side."

I look up and simply respond 'yes' with a grin on my face, at the very moment it happened a spark in the back of my head a buzz started to spread over my skin EXACTLY like LSD-25 that 'cold heat' buzz and tingle, this extraordinary feeling was accompanied by a rush of euphoria and excitement like candy flipping, taking MDMA and LSD-25 together, I have to say most unexperienced psychonauts would be more than overwhelmed at this point but this was the peak of a mountain ive trained and prepared for and was expecting, and my friend he is just a damn trooper, haha, and loved it, anywho this skin buzz grew and grew and grew where there was a point I recalculated the doses furiously, wondering, 'had I taken too much? should I be in a safer place before I reach its true peak and lose touch with reality 100% for the first time? Am I really ready for this?...' And then it happened..\r\n\n\n\nT:??:??h I felt as if I opened my eyes for the first time and was suspended in what seemed to represent space my friends were still visible and seemed to be there in the same floating upright posture with closed eyes and gentle smiles, and then I began to witness an ugly side of this other worldly suspension to skin buzz on my back facing, what was to me the appitomy of emptiness a, grew cold and consuming as if it was pulling me into a cold burning frying pan and never let me return to normal... \r\n\n\n\nBut I felt as if I was responsible for the comfort and safety of my subjects and managed to break away from this feeling and escape hitting the invisible frying pan. I then realized or think I had my eyes closed during that and when I escaped it I simply opened my eyes, at this point I thought I felt sober for the most part and started to feel a depressant feeling like a warm opiate buzz probly due to even more marijuana being consumed a, quarter of very high quality bud by pretty much just me, over the whole night, they arent big smokers, so to walk off and celebrate my escape I go outside with the group after convincing them to follow, after walking around and discussing this new fantastic compound I got the urge to go home to chill with my brother and try and sleep I felt a tad exhausted it was around 1:30am I took the first dose at like 5:00pm, I told the group I was going to walk home (home is exactly 3miles away) after reaching the main street a block a way looking down the street and watching it strech and wiggle made me realize I was still high, so I decided to return to the garage and be safe, and have my brother pick me up, after getting home I was at 10% of the peak OEVs I couldnt stand cartoons they light weight scared me, and movies were nice and empothatic like watching movies on E, more weed consumed, more sleepy warm feeling, my cat laid on my chest puring which caused me to fully realx, after sitting up and cracking my back, I lay back down reposition Molly ( my Serval Cat shes huge 35Lbs and slim lol) and drift away.. \r\n\n\n\nAmazing dreams indistinguishable from reality....\r\n\n\n\nAfter waking up I feel light still and a lil happier than usual, no headache, or drag, my pupils were very tiny where as they were huge at the peak, and an important note. . I noticed when I forgot to drink for about two hours after my second dose my veins began to constrict and as soon as fluids, gatorade, were ingested this was reversed, but all in all its very nice and seem to have lit physical side effects id have to say its like LSD-25 and MDMA in one godly compound I put its max safe, fun dose at 0.850mg taken as I have or 0.750mg oral at once and 0.475mg nasally at once"

        "report_text": "This report documents two back-to-back experiences I had smoking DMT while also under the influence of LSD and MDMA. The first experience was one of my most beautiful, and the second experience was definitely the most terrifying trip I have ever had. I went to both extremes, experiencing the light side and the dark side of DMT in a matter of hours.\r\n\n\n\nBackground: I am a 24 year old male weighing 120 pounds, in good mental and physical health. I take no medications although I do use marijuana and yerba mate on a daily basis. I have extensive experience with psychedelic drugs, and consider myself very familiar with tryptamines (mushrooms, LSD, DMT and 5-MeO-DMT alone or in combination with harmala alkaloids), phenethylamines (MDMA, Trichocereus cacti, 2C-I, 2C-E and 2C-B) and have some experience with dissociatives (Salvia, ketamine and DXM).\r\n\n\n\nSet and Setting: I was feeling uncomfortable in my crowded and chaotic home, and had a burning desire to get out of the house for a night. I had been worrying a lot about my financial security and the safety of my home, and just wanted to escape for a while. Conveniently, I was minding a beautiful home which I would have all to myself. Peace and quiet! Plus, the MDMA monkey was on my back again, urging me to scratch that itch. I have used MDMA a lot in the past, and have trouble controlling my usage. I tend to do too much, too often and have often used MDMA in a recreational and abusive manner. MDMA is my \u0093problem drug\u0094 you could say. \r\n\n\n\nI had picked up a gram of MDMA recently, doing so sneakily so that my partner wouldn\u0092t know. Not that she judges me, but I feel my use is not really healthy and not something I\u0092m proud of, so often I am scared to tell her. Sneaking around the bush never helps though, in fact I always end up breaking down and telling her after the fact how much I had taken. It is simpler and less emotional for me to just tell the truth from the beginning.\r\n\n\n\nThe Experience: So out I went, a pleasant warm spring night\u0092s walk on my way, winding through parks and along the edges of a golf course. I stopped to climb into a golden willow\u0092s branches and smoke a bowl. I had only intended on taking one or maybe two of the MDMA capsules (each containing 100 mg) tonight. Instead, by the time I got to my destination I had already taken three, and then proceeded to bump a little more when I got there. In total I ingested roughly 350 milligrams.\r\n\n\n\nI quickly became aware that I had taken too much. It was pretty shitty MDMA, I think there was some speed in there for sure because I felt a lot of jittery nervous sensations rather than the mellow relaxation of good, clean stuff. And the nystagmus! Man, my eyes were twitching like butterflies, I could barely see straight and my jaw was clenching pretty badly. What about my short term memory? I used to have one of those, now where did I put the damn thing?\r\n\n\n\nSo, what do you do to fill the hours from 1:30 AM to 8:30 AM while high on speedy MDMA? Creating a giant mandala of plants, rocks and other random household goodies, of course! It started off pretty simply, but by the time morning rolled around\u0085 well, you couldn\u0092t call it structured, simple, or even harmonious. Crammed, overcrowded and chaotic would all apply. I kept obsessively going out into the garden to pick handfuls of leaves, vines, fern fronds and spring flowers to decorate my mandala. I had nearly all the plants in the house piling up around the edges too!\r\n\n\n\nSo in the morning, feeling rough around the edges and having trouble regulating my electrolyte balance (drinking lots of liquids, but not having my thirst quenched) I called my partner, asking her to come over and meditate with me around my mandala. Haha. I was way too ADD to focus for more than a second, and instead of meditating just kept fiddling with bits of leaves and flowers, making small, obsessive changes to my decorations. My partner looked pretty sad, especially when I said I was going to stay here today and do some \u0093introspective, looking within myself\u0094 (also known as, getting real fuckin\u0092 high on drugs!). She went home still sad. Secretly, she knew I was high on MDMA. And secretly, I knew that she knew I was high on MDMA. But neither of us had said anything about it yet.\r\n\n\n\nIt was about 1 PM now, 13 hours after taking the MDMA. I hadn\u0092t slept in over 24 hours and hadn\u0092t eaten for about 17 hours. So you might say I was permeable to the spirit realms, having drawn a little closer to death myself over the last day. I feel MDMA particularly makes it easier for me to see shadow people, spirits and other spooky stuff. It takes me nearer to death and thus I can see behind the veil more clearly.\r\n\n\n\nI was pretty sure I was setting myself up for an introspective nightmare. Nevertheless, I went ahead with my plan, dropping four hits of good acid and a capsule of about 200 mg of MDMA for good measure (or because the monkey was on my back again, already! Stuff\u0092s got a sinister compelling edge to it!).\r\n\n\n\nAnd so, stage three of my plan of epic and debaucherous mind-dissolution: rolling a DMT doobie. I had a half gram of high purity Mimosa hostilis root bark extract, and decided to go heavy. Super heavy, actually, I used about half the vial (roughly 250 milligrams!). I had just a pinch of marijuana shake left, so I had to bulk out my plant material with some finely shredded labrador tea, bearberry leaf and a little bit of yarrow. These three herbs were still somewhat fresh, retaining a little moisture, which is a good thing for DMT doobies. Slow burning, warm enough to vaporize the DMT but not so hot as to scorch it. I added the finishing touch, a generous sprinkling of Coca tea, figuring it would numb the throat in a pleasant way.\r\n\n\n\nHalf an hour later, the MDMA and LSD I had taken were coming on, so I ventured out into the backyard for my special doobie. It was a beautiful sunny day, blue sky and green grass. I lay down with a shirt over my head to shade me from the sun, and sparked the joint. I smoked a couple hits, finding the taste extremely mild and mostly unnoticeable after the first toke. Very smooth, thanks to Mama Coca. It wasn\u0092t really hitting me hard the way a marijuana plus DMT joint usually does, but I shugged it off and puffed some more. Just keep smoking\u0085\r\n\n\n\nThe transition to DMT space was startling in its rapidity. One moment I was puffing, and perhaps the trees had begun to fractalize just a little. The next moment, BAM!!! Fully in. I vaguely remember sitting up and pushing the towel off my head as I went into the trance.\r\n\n\n\nThe trees were doing the most amazing dance ever! Thick, grey bark wrinkled up and down their trunks, the branches defining the planes of a complex three-dimensional space around the tree. There was this incredible sound, humming and hawing going up and down, warbling through different tones. A whirling, clanking mechanical sound like an amusement park ride, and these electric zing-ziiing noises. The trees were bouncing, dancing up and down as the sounds grew in intensity and pitch.\r\n\n\n\nWhen the vibrations reached a critical threshold, the trees would do a quarter-turn clockwise twist. Turning a corner, with a flash of green leaves, and then EXPLODING out the top with a hundred squiggly, purple-red octopus tentacles, as well as amazingly intricate diamond-block patterns in pale blues and black. It was the happy dancing tree carnival!\r\n\n\n\nI had this neat omni-vision thing going on, being able to see in every direction simultaneously. I would see the dances trees, oh yes, and the fractalizing sky, and even the grass I was lying on. The grass looked so crazy, it got all tall and spiky, looking like astroturf from a far distant planet. Everything in my vision was hyper-saturated in colour, a palette of blues, greens and the grey of the tree trunks.\r\n\n\n\nThe feeling went on for a long time, in repeating waves. Slowly, the waves became a little gentler, a little farther spaced apart. I began to piece my mind back together, realizing that this green stuff was grass, and that I was still lying in the yard. As I dropped totally out of the trance, I flipped myself over in a jarring way, which was an abrupt end to the trip. But WOW! What a trip! Possibly the most beautiful and amazing DMT experience I have ever had. The setting was what made it really magical. With the acid and MDMA on board, I stayed in the trance state longer than usually, probably 10 minutes or so. In other experiences I have noticed that LSD extends the duration of the DMT, and MDMA reduces my threshold to breakthrough.\r\n\n\n\nWhat I had just experienced was so magical, that I contemplated diving again, having enough material for one more doobie identical to the one I had just smoked. I thought of a better idea, however. I rang home again to my partner, after struggling for several minutes trying to remember our home number. Ahem\u0085 yes, there\u0092s that short term memory loss at its finest. Thanks MDMA, it will probably be a few more days before I can remember my own phone number again. When I finally got the number right, I convinced my partner to drop what she was doing and come back, right away. No, don\u0092t walk, take the car!\r\n\n\n\nI was super excited to share this experience with her. I figured having the exact same ratios of DMT and plant material as in my doobie, plus the exact same sunny backyard setting, and she should have a similarly amazing experience. She has smoked DMT before, but never gone all the way through, often feeling fearful as the intensity ramps up. I wanted to give her the experience I had just had, so that she would gain a comfort level with the breakthrough dose. I knew it would make her happy.\r\n\n\n\nIt was more difficult to roll this doobie, since by now I was really high. I couldn\u0092t actually see straight to put in the filter, so I got her to do that when she arrived. I rushed her into the yard almost as soon as she had walked in the door. Getting her to lay down the same way I had, with a view of the trees and sky,and I lit her joint. She puffed, once, twice, a couple more times. Her body started shaking all over, her hand still holding the doobie was trembling. After a few minutes she opened her eyes, saying she had gotten scared as the experience became overwhelming, and so she didn\u0092t want to smoke anymore. She enjoyed the level she went to though which was nice. She had smoked about the same as me, probably stopping just one toke short of the breakthrough point.\r\n\n\n\nBy now I was over-excited and twitchy feeling. The eye wiggles had started up again, and I was pretty sure this, or my enthusiastic speech patterns would give me away soon enough. I wanted to dive again, so I tried relighting my doobie. Oh yeah, I hadn\u0092t smoked the whole thing! After rolling the doobie for my partner, I said to myself, \u0093wait a minute, I couldn\u0092t possibly have smoked that whole thing!\u0094 There was a cardboard filter at the bottom, for one, so I must have flailed it somewhere as I came out of the trip. Sure enough, a quick search and there it was. I had only managed to smoke about a third of it, apparently having fallen into the trance as I was smoking. Factoring in a little loss due to smouldering plant material, and that the DMT runs down the joint away from the heat, I figure I still got around 75 milligrams. A hefty dose. With shaky hands, I tried lighting the joint again, but three times it went out right away. Perhaps I should have taken that as a sign\u0085\r\n\n\n\nMy partner said she would like to try the DMT again, if I would go first. I guess she wanted to see someone else in the deep trance, for reassurance. Well, reassurance was definitely not on the plate this afternoon.\r\n\n\n\nA reminder, that I was under conditions of sleep deprivation, fasting, drug abuse and still coming up on 4 hits of acid plus 200 mg of MDMA going into this experience. Yikes, sometimes I really disgust myself. I lay down in the sun again, with the rest of my doobie. In retrospect, it was a bad idea to be lying down while smoking a DMT doobie. I should have stayed sitting up until going under, you will see why soon\u0085\r\n\n\n\nI puffed once, twice, good deep hauls. I could see the trees begin to shimmer and twist just a little, thinking \u0093here we go!\u0094 This is where my experience of events and her experience of events diverge rapidly. I will tell my side of the tale first, and then follow it up with what she observed. In my experience, I started taking a third haul on the joint. All of a sudden I sucked a big chunk of hot ash and leaf material into my mouth, I felt it hit the back of my throat. An acrid bitter taste and smell permeated my mouth. At the same time, in my visual field the delicate lace-patterned trees were no more. This contamination, a black spot at the centre of my vision, grew outward rapidly like a mold or rust fungus. Everything it touched turned black, and then crumbled into ash. I felt the tone and feeling of the trip change, from light to dark.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Are you okay?\u0094 she asked. \r\n\n\n\n\u0093Yes,\u0094 I replied. Feeling not too deep in the trance state, despite everything being a fractal blur, I leaned over to spit out the ash from my mouth. My partner\u0092s voice drifted over to me, and my head followed the sound very rapidly indeed.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Papy, I\u0092m dead!\u0094 She said.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093WHAT???\u0094 I cried.\r\n\n\n\nHer bottom lip was quivering as she asked, \u0093How can I be dead? I wasn\u0092t dead two seconds ago!\u0094\r\n\n\n\nOur eyes met, and we both simultaneously said, \u0093Fuck!\u0094 I dropped my eyes in anguish. \u0093Fuck!\u0094 Everything in this DMT space was the polar opposite to my last trip. Instead of vibrant blues, greens and greys, the landscape had a lot of neon green with a malevolent washover of magenta. This was supposed to be my trip, my experience, and now instead she was dead!\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Papy, look at me!\u0094 She demanded. That brought my gaze up fast. I looked into her left eye, seeing the iris open up. I knew that I was taking an exact imprint of her, in that moment. I realized something then. You know what they say about love, when you find The One, you know. I knew in this moment, that she was The One. I had found her. Only through a cruel twist of circumstances, my going into DMT space had prematurely snuffed out her life. Something had gone terribly wrong. We were perfect for each other, but it has her fate to die and mine to live. I knew I would be lonely after she died. She was The One, and now she was dead\u0085 \r\n\n\n\nHer demanding me to look at her had made me aware of the essence of her womanhood, and it aroused in me an irresistable compulsion. I had to take my pants off, and do her right here! \u0093No!\u0094 She said, \u0093You can\u0092t do that here!\u0094 \r\n\n\n\nAll I could think to say was \u0093I DON\u0092T CARE!\u0094 I needed her, but she wouldn\u0092t let me take my pants off. \u0093FUCK!\u0094 I said again.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Why do you keep saying fuck? It\u0092s okay, Papy!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093How can it be okay that you are dead???\u0094 I asked.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093That\u0092s the way it is now,\u0094 she replied.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Fuck!\u0094 Then, after a moment, I said \u0093You\u0092re right. This is the way it is now. I guess I can accept that you are dead.\u0094 It was brutal but also okay that she was dead. \u0093This is the way it is now.\u0094\r\n\n\n\nSlowly, slowly my mind began to scrabble at a return. I wasn\u0092t yet aware of it, but as she now asked me, \u0093Why do you keep saying fuck? Who are you talking to?\u0094 it was the real girl I was hearing, and not a hallucination.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Why do you keep saying that I am dead?\u0094 and I could see tears in her eyes.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Well, look at you! You\u0092re dead.\u0094 Indeed, as the veils had lifted a grey pallor had come over her face. It was obvious to me that she was dead. The burning need to get naked and do her, right there in the yard, was still strong in me, but again she stopped me from taking off my pants.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Why do you keep touching your penis?\u0094 She asked. \r\n\n\n\n\u0093Because I need you!\u0094 I reply. I was getting closer, the fractal blur seemed to thin just a little\u0085 As usual, dropping out of the trance state happens just as abruptly as going into it. A bump, bump, bump and back into my body. I realized that what I was experiencing had been just a trip, and not reality. It was like waking up from a terribly twisted, sadistic dreams. Coming out of my trip, and realizing it didn\u0092t actually happen, gave me the hugest rush of relief and happiness.\r\n\n\n\nThe first sane words out of my mouth were, \u0093You\u0092re not actually dead!!\u0094 and I bearhugged her. \r\n\n\n\nShe sounded really scared when she said, \u0093Are you okay?\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Yes!\u0094 came my emphatic reply.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093What happened?\u0094 she questioned.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093It was just a different experience. The first one was all light, and this one was all dark.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Are you sure you\u0092re okay?\u0094 she asked again.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093I am 100% okay, other than having sucked a bearberry leaf into the back of my mouth. I guess I can accept one bearberry leaf in return for having had a different experience.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093What are you talking about?\u0094 she asks, sounding lost.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093I sucked some ash into my mouth. Probably a bearberry leaf, you have to shred them pretty fine. I can feel it back there,\u0094 and I hawked some phlegm. \r\n\n\n\nI started tripping out on the fractalizing trees behind her head, but she said \u0093Papy, look at me! Stay with me!\u0094 and so I did.\r\n\n\n\nShe looked at me as if I were crazy, and I told her not to worry, that everything was okay. \u0093You\u0092re The One, love! I am never going to leave you.\u0094\r\n\n\n\nThen, she dropped the first bombshell: \u0093Papy,\u0094 she said, \u0093you dropped the whole joint in your mouth.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093WHAT???\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093\u0085 and I didn\u0092t know if you had done it deliberately or not. I was going to take it out, but then you chewed it up a bit and spat some out.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Seriously? No wonder my throat feels so raw!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0094Why did you keep saying fuck? Who were you talking to?\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093I was talking to you, except that you had died. Somehow, when I went into the trip you died. It was just apparent to me that you were dead.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093How much do you remember of your experience?\u0094 she asked.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093All of it, perfectly.\u0094 I said, which is kind of true. I remember my side of it perfectly.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093What was all that rolling around on the ground about?\u0094 She asked.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Was I rolling around on the ground?\u0094 I asked, baffled. After that initial surge of relief, I now experienced an acute wave of paranoia. I was SO GLAD she wasn\u0092t dead, but realized I had probably been shouting my side of the conversation outside, for the whole world to hear. That\u0092s the kind of behaviour that gets you committed to the insane asylum, for sure. \u0093Can we please go inside right now?\u0094 I ask, not waiting for a reply and just running inside, all freaked out. Hoping the cops wouldn\u0092t come knocking at my door, which I closed and locked.\r\n\n\n\nWe sat down and began to piece together our different versions of what happened. I was quite surprised at how different our two accounts were. My partner was super shaken, she had thought that my mind had broken, and that I wasn\u0092t going to come out of this trip. That she would be dead to me hereafter. It took a while of reassurances and me talking sanely to convince her I wasn\u0092t permanently loco. I also came clean about my using MDMA the last couple days, which was nice. I had that sense of clarity, to realize that lying, stealthiness or sneakiness get me nowhere. They are entirely counterproductive. I asked her how loud I had been, had I been shouting? She said it wasn\u0092t that loud. Also, of the stuff I said to her in my trip, only some of it did I actually say out loud. I also apparently said some stuff that I don\u0092t remember at all.\r\n\n\n\nThis seems a good place to start my partner\u0092s side of the story, how things actually happened: The first two tokes, are the same in both versions of the story. It is on the third toke that they diverge from one another. In my version, I take a third drag, not feeling much yet\u0085 In actuality, I was already inside of the experience without knowing it. Extremely fast transition. \r\n\n\n\nMy partner said it looked like I was going to take a third toke, I brought the doobie close to my mouth\u0085 paused a bit\u0085 and then dropped the whole fucking thing into my mouth! This is why I said, not smart to smoke a DMT joint while lying down. Apparently I chewed it up and spat out a little, but I ate the filter for sure and probably a good chunk of the joint as well. Gross. No wonder it tasted so bad.\r\n\n\n\nThen apparently I crawled around on the ground for awhile, kneeding the earth spastically. She asked me what I was doing, and apparently I replied \u0093Rolling around on the ground and having fun!\u0094 I have no recollection of this, and I certainly wasn\u0092t having any fun!\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Do you remember me restraining you?\u0094 She asked.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093WHAT???\u0094 I said again. \u0093No!\u0094\r\n\n\n\nShe said I kept grabbing the ground, and her flesh as well, pulling with a strong force. I got pretty forceful when I was trying to take of my pants and do her. She apparently told me \u0093I don\u0092t want to have sex right now! You don\u0092t even know who I am!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Yes I do!\u0094 I said (again, I have no recollection of this conversation).\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Who am I then? What\u0092s my name?\u0094 All I could do was stare blankly. She tried again, \r\n\n\u0093Do you know who Star (our very close friend) is?\u0094 I continued to stare blankly. Getting forceful again apparently, and she pushed me to the ground. She must have been absolutely terrified, thinking I had just gone mad forever. She said sometimes I would look into her eyes, almost lucid, but then would just zone out again.\r\n\n\n\nIntegration:  I was in the trance state a long time, probably 10-12 minutes. Acid tends to lengthen the effects of DMT, and MDMA definitely reduces the threshold to breakthrough. My partner suggested that my body might have been possessed by spirits while I was in the trance state. Certainly this is possible, having sudden intense finger strength, and saying stuff I don\u0092t remember while experiencing something totally different from the world around me. Having uncontrollable sexual compulsions. Could also just be my mind working on a sub-conscious level, my conscious mind being totally involved in a terrifying experience activating some primative survival pathways in the mind.\r\n\n\n\nThe way everything turned to black in my vision, when the joint hit the back of my mouth, makes me wonder if a nasty entity snuck its way into the joint between sessions. It\u0092s pretty odd to drop a joint in your mouth, I remember doing it only once before in all my years of pot smoking. The way the blackness in my vision spread was like a mold or a disease contaminant of some kind. I also pondered whether the woman I had been interacting with was my real partner. Possibly another entity could take on her form and appearance, in order to trick me and try to gain control over me. Reminder to self: specifically state, only entities who are friendly, benevolent and helpful are invited!\r\n\n\n\nBy the time we were finished discussing, my partner was pretty calm. I, however, was trying to come to terms with what I had experienced. I began to worry, fearing that some aspect of my vision might actually be true. That she would die, maybe not soon but a whole lot sooner than me, and that I would have to live my life without her. Afraid that maybe, somehow, I had actually killed her through my actions. Talk about unforseen consequences of drug use! I was freaked out, and then some.\r\n\n\n\nIt took a long, hot bath, a lot of crying and a cup of jasmine tea before I calmed down a little. Coming out of the craziest, scariest and most harrowing DMT trip I have ever had, peaking on four hits of acid and 200 mg of MDMA seemed pretty tame, in comparison. The emotional shock was just that, shocking. I was overwhelmed by my experience, trying to wrap my mind around it and failing.\r\n\n\n\nTime went on, and we went home and ate some nice grounding food (I hadn\u0092t eaten in a long time), I slowly came back to being okay. I decided that it is not within my power, by smoking DMT, to kill another individual. Certainly it is within my power to believe I have killed another person, while under the influence. What can be really frightening about these sorts of trips in DMT space is that it feels absolutely, vividly real while you are there. More real than real, almost.\r\n\n\n\nI realized though, that it does not matter whether what I saw is \u0093real\u0094 or not. We live our lives the same, regardless. Whether we die today or in sixty years, there is nothing we can do about it and no way to know the outcome before it happens. All we can do is live our lives fully, in each moment of every day. I wondered why I had been shown this vision. If DMT is a teacher medicine, then I should be learning lessons from this experience. I guess too, if she were to die, this gives me a reference point for that experience. DMT teaches us a lot about the death process, leraning to let go smoothly. I don\u0092t believe that what I saw is real, however. Not everything you see and hear in DMT space is real or reliable. A lot is trickery, illusion, or something shown so that you can grow from it. I question everything that I see in DMT space. I feel I was shown my biggest fear through this experience, the fear of being alone.\r\n\n\n\nIn retrospect, I don\u0092t regret this experience. It was hard for a while, seeing what I had and knowing there is no way to go back in time to before you went through the experience. If I wasn\u0092t ready for the experience, then it wouldn\u0092t have come to me. That said, I do not ever want to go back to that particular place. Some trips you have once, so you know that type of trip is possible\u0085 and then you don\u0092t need to have it again. I couldn\u0092t sleep that night, still feeling freaked out, and I wrote the bulk of this report to let it out of my mind and gain some peace. Pushing 45 hours awake, and the sleep deprivation hallucinations were kicking in.\r\n\n\n\nAddendum: It has been two months since this experience. It has been a challenging experience to integrate, I would say I am about three quarters of the way through the integration process. The experience was so real that just thinking about it is enough to get my heart pounding. I was left with a lot of fear, a lot of lingering dread that what I experienced was real. I am learning an important lesson, how to live my life in love and not in fear. I have to choose, day by day, to let go of the fear. I have to choose to live in love and be happy.\r\n\n\n\nI have had one \u0093flashback\u0094 to this experience. I had been at an intentional dance that day, a guided dance where we would bring up and express different emotions such as fear, ecstasy, anger and so on. This guided dance had brought my fears to the surface. Later that night, we ate some mushrooms with a capsule of harmala alkaloids. When these substances came on, I experienced a moment of pure fear. I worried again that what I had seen might somehow be true. My body actually went into shock, and I got really chilled and shaky. Though challenging, this was a good process to go through. I feel that by bringing up the fear I was able to start letting go of it, realizing how irrational fear is. I was able to face my fear, and allow it to pass over and through me.\r\n\n\n\nI have not felt called to work with DMT since the trip, I don\u0092t feel I can have a new experience until I finish integrating this one. I did roll a small joint with just a little bit of DMT the other day, with the intention of understanding my relation to the substance, and to let go of my fears. I choose a calming natural setting, and took a couple puffs. Just enough to be aware of the energy flow, nowhere near a breakthrough dose. I could see the trees around me dancing again, but was lucid enough to know the reality behind the dancing trees. The trees themselves are real, but my perception of them is very malleable. This is what DMT does, it plays with my perceptions. What I experience in DMT space is a construct of my own mind. It does not have its own reality, all DMT can do is show me things. It shows me aspects of my mind, but does not create reality. That is comforting.\r\n\n\n\nOne thing I keep coming back to is respect. Respect for the medicine is crucial. Set, setting and intent are crucial. I was in a pretty dark place when I had that scary trip, pushing myself too hard and abusing MDMA again. Had my preparation and intent been more solid, perhaps I wouldn\u0092t have needed such a harrowing trip. DMT is an extremely powerful substance, and I had been using it recklessly and in combination with other drugs. I respect its power a lot more now.\r\n\n\n\nThis was a very powerful learning experience for me. I feel one aspect of the experience does ring true: my partner is The One. This experience showed me clearly our connection, and what I would feel if I lost her. Doing MDMA sneakily behind her back, generally disrespecting myself and her as well, is not a healthy place to be in. It makes me truly grateful for my ordinary everday life. Truly grateful to live in love with this wonderful woman. DMT is a teacher, and this harsh lesson was there to nudge me back on my path.\r\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, may you live each moment of every day to its fullest, choosing to live in love and not in fear.\r\n\n\n\n erodrops01"

        "report_text": "How do you expect, the unexpected? How do you describe the indescribable? How do you believe the unbelievable? And how do you question the unquestionably flawless intelligence of gods mind? You don\u0092t. You sit back with trusted friends, you raise a glass pipe to your lips, you inhale 3 times and then you dive soul first into an ocean of seamless reality that either washes over you like a mother bathing her child or crashes onto you as if the heavens fell from the skies. Welcome to hyperspace.\r\n\n\n\nIt seems I only post after a particularly enlightening and sensational psychedelic journey, and I suppose that\u0092s all that\u0092s needed. If I were to leave the epic insights of tripping to mere memory, I\u0092m afraid I\u0092d lose the vast majority of it to the constant bombardment of constricted thinking, close minded perceptions and petty emotions that race through my mind daily. A documented reference to mystical experiences serves to capture and savor my fleeting glimpses of divine truth.\r\n\n\n\nThe day was set and the participants selected. We sat in humble unison on the floor as shpongle accentuated the atmosphere with an ominous foreshadowing of events to come. There was limited conversation as the pipe was being loaded with a yellow crystal that seemed to unconsciously demand respect. There were 6 of us, 3 newcomers and 3 experienced DMT travelers, yet all of us nervously waited for someone else to volunteer for the first smoke. A timid 'I\u0092ll go first' broke the silence, but I followed with 'I will, if you\u0092d like, I\u0092ll go first.' I figured someone vaguely familiar with the power of DMT should handle the inauguration of the sacrament, while simultaneously being reminded by another traveler, the product was extracted by my hands, it would only be right for me to christen it.\r\n\n\n\nIt was then that my heart began to pound, I was nearly overwhelmed by the impending intoxication that would soon be take control of my senses. After exhaling my first hit though, I was immersed in what seemed like a warm electric bath, so encompassing, so reassuring. I exhaled my second hit, deeper now I sank into a lake of exotic visions. I only opened my eyes to see the pipe for a third toke, as I exhaled again a fabric of warping designs gave way to a female being who seemed to offer herself to me, without consciously deciding I observed myself taking advantage of the opportunity and throwing myself upon her.\r\n\n\n\nImmediately I pulled myself up I realized there are more important things to do and decided to explore, I then saw countless people walking frantically from place to place. It felt like I was in a restaurant watching servers bustle about. Working on something. They were quite indifferent to me being there. As the drug metabolized in my body the world grew fainter and fainter until disappearing into blackness. I opened my eyes, physically and emotionally I felt quite refreshed, but felt spiritually lacking, as if I had missed something. Slightly disappointed but otherwise completely tranquil and thankful for having a pleasant experience, we sat in silence once more as the pipe was being loaded.\r\n\n\n\n4 more people smoked but none attained a breakthrough experience.  Then the person who had first volunteered for the first trip was up, she took 4 solid and thorough hits and for 5 to ten minutes we watched as she undeniably 'broke through.' it was very powerful watching her lifting and raising her head while breathing heavily and sensuously, eyes closed and soul deep. After she came back into this material view of things she slowly elaborated on what happened. I then inspected the pipe and figured there was sufficient amount of buildup still inside the bulb to attempt another session of my own. By this point though, I think I was under appreciating the awesome power of DMT after feeling a tad shortchanged by my initial experience, and apparently ignoring the intense behaviors of the previous traveler.\r\n\n\n\nFirst hit, long and slow. I hold deep, 10 seconds at least, exhale. Damn, this is heavy, I hand the pipe to friend so I wouldn\u0092t have to worry about holding it myself. 2nd hit, I dunno if I like this, my heart is pounding and my lungs are sore from my first trip. I\u0092m in a state of unease and paranoia, I can\u0092t die from this right? My awareness is harassed by an onslaught of frightening thoughts and a menacing carpet of hallucinations obscuring my view. I don\u0092t want anymore, the pipe is smoking and ready for a third hit, I don\u0092t want to back down, but I don\u0092t want to go further. My chest is pounding, I think I\u0092m dying. I press my lips against the glass and drag, my lungs are so raped its hard to keep inhaling, but I manage. I hold in, exhale. Blast off. God damn, where I am? I want to go home, my chest feels as if there is a hole in it, as if my heart is missing. This is so painful, I\u0092m alone, I\u0092m scared and I want my heart back, I want to be alright. Wait... what is this, what is this presence around me, am I not alone?\r\n\n\n\nI\u0092m in a room. There are two adults, female and male. I sense their glorious power, it flows off them like the sun radiates light. I am a child here, ignorant, frightened and confused. I only see them from their waist down to their feet, I don\u0092t even try to look up to them, I am not worthy. I\u0092m not the only child, there is a table/box full of toys and there is a young child exploring them. My god, this is so intense, I dunno if I like it. Panic grips my body once again, everything is so alien and terrifying. Wait, I\u0092m here! I\u0092m right here, right now! I\u0092ve dreamed of being here, I\u0092ve fantasied about meeting these beings, I\u0092ve prayed for conclusive answers possibly arising from a 'breakthrough' experience, and here I am. Why am I clinging so tight to my thoughts and emotions, why not investigate, forget life and death, absorb myself into what is happening right now.\r\n\n\n\nI\u0092m in the room, and without speaking I ask the adults why I\u0092m here, immediately she hands me a toy. I look at it, its some magnificent geometrical building block. I stare into it, focus entirely on it. It begins to glow bright, I focus harder, it glows brighter, it transmits an energy to me, something familiar. The feeling overwhelms me and it feels heavenly, my god, this is true love, and I felt it before, my heart is back again, there is no more hole, just complete wholeness. I look back up at the child playing with the toys, he is so happy now, he begins tossing his toys into the air in celebration and it hits me. This is the love I have for my son, it is a reflection of my intense feelings for him.\r\n\n\n\nUnexpectedly I\u0092m reminded of all the times I haven\u0092t been the best father I\u0092m capable of being, I\u0092m reminded of my thoughts of moving some where else, not to leave him, but to start fresh some where else and to visit him when I can. These thoughts instantly wrench my heart from my chest I am sucked into a tornado of hellish anxiety, utter despair and guilt. No, I cannot, I will not leave him. He is my inspiration for living, and without him I will die, whether it be physically, emotionally or spiritually, or all 3, I will wither into nothingness without his love. As soon as I realize this I am back in the room. The adults are moving about quicker now, as if in a hurry, I start thanking them for showing me this and how beautiful it is. I begin to get teary eyed by thinking about my emotions and again I am filled with a veil of hallucinations that depict love and remorse. I realize that I am under the influence of a short acting drug and I need to go back to the room before I lose touch with it.\r\n\n\n\nI\u0092m back in the room. The adults are running now and things are starting to git dimmer and dimmer. I ask what else they have to show me, the female strikes me as if reprimanding a child. As if she was saying 'listen now, pay attention, stop drifting off, this is IMPORTANT!' she then hands me a mystical looking hourglass as she squats down, she is in full view now and I can feel her love pouring over me. She reaches in and pulls a handful of the most serene white glistening sand imaginable and allows it to fall I reach my hands out and catch it. It flows through my fingers and it is orgasmic, pure love is all about and as this sand slides into my hand and slips through the cracks of my fingers I understand what she is telling me. Time is the most precious thing we have. It is fantastic and inconceivable, it is also as brief and fleeting as every grain of sand that falls through the cracks of my hand. 'Use the time you are given wisely, enjoy the precious moments of life and celebrate them with your son. Your life is only as full and rich as you make it, and your son is the measure of your worth...' fade to black.\r\n\n\n\nI cry. I begin to shake and I try my hardest to convey the deepest of thanks to these beings, they opened my eyes to the beauty of life that has always been in front of my face. I\u0092ve always known he was my purpose but to have something, someone so powerful demonstrate so explicitly how meaningful he is, was jaw dropping. I cry some more. I open my eyes and everyone sits in silence. The energy in the room is sublime. I wipe my tears and say my goodbyes."

        "report_text": "Let me preface this account by saying I have had many previous experiences with psychedelics, which I believe properly prepared me for my first DMT trip.\r\n\n\n\nThis experience occurred this past weekend at the Gathering of the Vibes music festival in Bridgeport, CT. My friend and I were fortunate enough to find a dealer in the campsite who not only had some very kind dope, but also DMT. We purchased a \u00bd gram. Over the course of the last few months I\u0092d been avidly reading about DMT experiences, and was very curious and excited to try it for myself. My plan was to trip on mushrooms that evening and try the DMT early the following day. That night, while shrooming, I made a conscious effort to continuously direct strong, positive thoughts towards myself and my place in the universe. I was hoping to cultivate a strong, positive experience with the DMT the next day, as I had read of people having very difficult experiences with the drug. \r\n\n\n\nThe next day my friend and I found a spot on the beach, directly across from the \u0093Green Vibes\u0094 stage where one musical act was ending and other beginning to tune up. I sat back in a lawn chair, facing Long Island Sound, and proceeded to prepare my pipe. I was somewhat concerned because I\u0092d read many people\u0092s accounts of the proper way to smoke DMT (water pipes, vaporizers, butane lighters, etc) and I had none of those things. Only a very small glass piece and a run of the mill lighter. Still, I could not help but be aware at this point of a strong sense of purpose around what I was about to attempt. It was palpable, this feeling that I was supposed to be right here right now. Using the tip of a pen cap, I measured (very approximately) 10-15 milligrams of the brownish-yellow power onto the weed in my piece. Then I covered it with another small bud. \r\n\n\n\nSince I had no idea what to expect, I gave my friend simple instructions: \r\n\n\n\n1.Take the piece from me when I finish\r\n\n\n\n2.If I appear to be in any kind of distress, say nothing. Just hold my hand.\r\n\n\n\nThe wind coming off the water was strong, and so I pulled a towel over my head and lit up. I lit the bowl slowly, drawing a deep breath and holding the smoke in my lungs for about 20-30 seconds. Upon exhalation, I tasted pot and nothing else. I waited about two minutes, and while I was definitely stoned I knew I hadn\u0092t gotten a good enough hit of the DMT. I asked my friend to sprinkle in some more, and thankfully he instead suggested I try one more hit first. I hit it again, and this time I instantly became aware of a sharp, acrid flavor filling my lungs and nostrils. Believing I\u0092d hit gold, I took in as much smoke as possible and held it for a full thirty seconds before exhaling. I slumped back in my lawn chair and took note of the clear, cloud tickled sky. \r\n\n\n\nAbout 5 seconds after laying back I became aware of a kind of \u0093film\u0094 drawing down over my vision. I recall thinking at that time: It looks like several large parameciums have landed on my eyeballs. They undulated and slid with ease, slippery living pools of near-invisible protoplasm, speckled and busy indeed. \r\n\n\n\nI watched the clouds and sky from behind this odd, primordial curtain, and then became aware of a warm numbness cascading down my cheeks and throat. My heart was beating rapidly, and I knew I was on my way. There was no fear at this time, yet there was the idea of fear. Fear floated over to the right side of my consciousness, and I sensed its selfish desire to assert itself. Instead I turned my attention away and to the sounds of the band still tuning up on stage. I knew that once some music began the fear would not have the resources to stick around me, and I would be on my way towards something wonderful. \r\n\n\n\nThe band seemed to take forever to launch into a song. I was aware that the noise of the front man going on and on about \u0093how good it is to be here on this beautiful Friday, etc. etc.\u0094 had taken on a deep, vibrating quality. It was as if the sound was being picked up and amplified not in my ear drums, but in the very center of my body, and traveling outward from within. My heart beat faster, and the thought that this band may never play a song allowed the fear to draw in closer and begin to take hold. \r\n\n\n\nIt was at this time that the music finally exploded out into the air, and I experienced BLASTOFF. The numbness that had begun on my face quickly cascaded down the rest of me, and I was separated entirely from my physical form. I closed my eyes, but the sky with its glorious clouds remained, but then began to shift and split as a series of brightly colored spiral fractals spun down from beyond the sky. The lines of this fractal were thin, and clearly something small within them, too tiny to see, was moving. The cloud/sky space between the fractal lines suddenly darkened and began to pulse with a sickly purple, bruised color. I understood that this was the FEAR that was still traveling right along with me. The only part of my body that remained was my heart, which I became sure would soon explode. \r\n\n\n\nThen there was a voice. I use the word \u0093voice\u0094 in the loosest sense, for what I really experienced was the \u0093knowing\u0094 of another given to me. I heard it audibly, but felt it just as clearly and simultaneously saw the message as it unfurled on a bright white banner that drew itself across the sick, purple-fear expanse, its edges attaching each one of the pretty fractal spirals. Written on the banner, clear as day, was the message:\r\n\n\n\nYOU HAVE TAKEN A POWERFUL PSYCHEDELIC.\r\n\n\n\nThis message, experienced visually, audibly, and within my consciousness, was undoubtedly female. There was no tone to lend it a friendly or unfriendly disposition; it was simply supplying me with information.\r\n\n\n\nI continued to soar forward. Another banner/voice/feeling delivered by this female voice shot across my conscious. It said: \r\n\n\n\nWE WANT TO SEE YOU, BUT YOU HAVE TO SLOW DOWN YOUR BREATHING FIRST. TAKE DEEP BREATHS. \r\n\n\n\nUpon receiving this advice, I was aware of a new presence of mind within me. While I was primarily in a state of heightened wonder and no small degree of panic, what rose up within me was a kind of no-nonsense, cold rationality that initiated within me a deep, rhythmic breathing exercise I\u0092d practiced often in meditation. As I breathed, the pulsing sick purple fear masses began to dissipate, while the spiral lines grew thicker and expanded outward. I picked up speed, and was very, very faintly aware that far below where my body sat, a strong ocean wind was blowing against my face. \r\n\n\n\nSuddenly I became aware of shapes that were attempting to break through the multicolored surface of the fractal spirals. There was a pushing upward, until finally out popped a small, perfectly spherical and bright green head. It spun and smiled wide at me, its eyes two mere slits of hilarity, before fully popping out of the surface and beginning to dance along with the music. Then I spotted another, then another. Soon the spiral fractal completed its formation of an endless tunnel, made up completely of these green, dancing men. I was familiar with the accounts of machine elves. These looked more like the Doozers from Fraggle Rock, which some of you might remember. They danced in unison, and began to speak to me.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Hooray! You made it!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093We\u0092re so glad you\u0092re here!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093We\u0092ve been waiting for you to find us again!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Hooray!\u0094\r\n\n\n\nI simply marveled at this, and was distantly aware that back on earth my body was laughing. Every so often a sickly purple head would pop out of the fractal, and suddenly there would be an angry little man, with a frown made of pure electricity. He would stare at me and say something profoundly distressing, like: \r\n\n\n\n\u0093Now you\u0092re dying!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093You\u0092re going insane forever!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Your best friend hates you!\u0094\r\n\n\n\nHowever, before any real fear could gather itself, one or more of the happy green men would surround the purple guy, and kick and/or karate chop him off the fractal and into a dark center that was slowly revealing itself at the center of everything. As they did this they would say things like:\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Don\u0092t listen to him, he\u0092s just confused.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093He\u0092ll come back understanding better the next time.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093You\u0092re doing great! Hooray!'\r\n\n\n\nSuddenly I became aware of a tremendous insight into what I was experiencing. This insight was presented to me, again, through several medium at once: I was being told it by the green men, I was seeing the truth of it in the pattern materialized before me, as though the mere existence of this image ensured it was true, as well as being struck by a strong familiarity from the experience as a whole. The insight was this:\r\n\n\n\nThis was the force of the universe, of creation, of everything. It is continuously moving, working itself into higher and higher consciousness. The images before me were just that, images, created by my mind to give form to what is essentially formless. The green men illustrated this last point by suddenly looking at me and saying: \u0093We can be whatever you want. We can be chipmunks!\u0094 and they became chipmunks. \u0093We can be fire hydrants!\u0094 and they all became fire hydrants. \u0093It doesn\u0092t matter, Hooray!!!\u0094 and then returned to little green men.\r\n\n\n\nI understood that this dancing, this moving, was really them working towards the higher consciousness; and that back on earth this gleeful dancing manifested in the acts of kindness, love and generosity of people towards each other. I understood that our physical reality (including the notions of time and space) was merely a reflection caused by the vibrating energy of this process, and was not \u0093real\u0094 in any sense of the word. The true nature of everything was vibration, and it emanated and danced around a singular point of nothingness. This nothingness, I came to understand, was all there ever was or ever will be. However, the notion of \u0093nothing\u0094 naturally implies the idea of \u0093something\u0094\u0097and that is what we are. The implication of possibility generated by the truth of utter nothingness. \r\n\n\n\nAs if to demonstrate this point, I was shown snapshots of events from throughout my life, from infant years to events from that very day. The picture of the event (say, for example, the birth of my daughter, or me falling off the slide in 3rd grade) would fill my field of vision. Then it would freeze, like a snapshot, and grown smaller and smaller until the spiral fractal tunnel returned and the snapshot was being held in the hands by one of the green men, who would then toss it back into the nothingness.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093See? It\u0092s just a picture! Hooray!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093This is all that\u0092s real!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Us!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093You!\u0094\r\n\n\n\nThe concepts of \u0093us\u0094 and \u0093me\u0094 and the very concept of separation as a whole suddenly manifested itself as a giant billboard, and that too was snap-shotted and tossed away into the nothing.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093This is all it is! Everything is one! You are it! Everyone is!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093THIS IS IT!!!\u0094 \r\n\n\n\nThis insight was celebrated by a massive \u0093Hooray!!!!\u0094 by the green men. Then went on to say things like:\r\n\n\n\n\u0093It\u0092s so simple!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Yeah! You see it now!\u0094 \r\n\n\n\n\u0093Were so glad you see it!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093It\u0092s you! It\u0092s everything! \r\n\n\n\nThen they all simultaneously donned black graduation caps and gowns, removed a certificate of graduation from behind them, stamped it, signed and held it up to me while giving me a big \u0093thumbs up\u0094. \r\n\n\n\n\u0093Okay, back to work! Let\u0092s go! Hooray!!!\u0094\r\n\n\n\nThe spiral tunnel gradually began to slow and grow thinner. From behind this vision I began to make out the frail outlines of clouds and sky. The music continued to jam on, and my fingers began to tap the arms of the lawn chair. I was returning to my body. With my eyes now open, I could still see the little green men who continued to dance in circles behind the sky. Faintly they cried:\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Come back again soon!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093We\u0092re always here!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093We\u0092d love you see you!\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Good job today! Hooray!\u0094\r\n\n\n\nI sat up and looked at my friend, who promptly said:\r\n\n\n\n\u009315 minutes! You were there for 15 minutes.\u0094\r\n\n\n\nThe very notion of time was still absurd to me, as I still felt primarily within the reality of the spiral truth, as opposed to the physical realm. This euphoric feeling of belonging and beauty remained with me throughout the weekend, though the exact nature and profound sense of truth and familiarity of the experience has begun to fade away. I have, however, continued to have faint closed eye visuals as late as last night (2 days later). This account is the best I could surmise and approximate the experience.\r\n\n\n\nI can\u0092t wait to go back there again, and see some more!"

        "report_text": "I consider myself an intrepid but cautious and scientific psychonaut, taking low doses at first and gently exploring my way into higher doses of LSD, psilocybin, salvia, 2-C-B, and \u0093Ecstasy\u0094, whatever MD* compound and/or misc. uppers those pills might have been. If I had to estimate, I would say I have taken psychedelics on between 20-40 occasions in the past 10 years and never had a 'bad trip.' Having recently helped my friend Freddie extract and purify DMT from a botanical source I found myself in a position to experiment after 5+ years of reading and preparing my psyche to do DMT. I took multiple threshold doses to familiarize my body with the physiological effects of this chemical. I also took 2 larger doses: one with a sitter which was satisfactory but alien, and one alone which caused a bit of panic.\r\n\n\n\nI decided I would smoke DMT alone this night, again, even though the last time I used it alone was a mildly frightening but completely satisfying experience. This is only the 3rd time I have taken DMT above a threshold dose. I prepared my \u0093launch pad...\u0094\r\n\n\n\nLighting:\r\n\n\n\nIt is dark outside, so there will be no natural light on this trip. Primary lighting is from my 55gal Turtle tank, with a 48\u0094 black-light providing supplemental lighting in a corner of the room. I also allowed full incandescent light in the hallway leading to the bathroom and my bedroom which bled out considerably to my \u0093launch pad.\u0094\r\n\n\n\nSeating:\r\n\n\n\nI've placed my beanbag full of memory foam in front of the turtle tank, knowing that my eyes, if I open them, will be drawn to the primary light source anyway. I also spent a good 5 minutes imprinting a comfortable butt-print into the bag to eliminate the need to re-situate myself while riding the chemical rocketship that I will soon prepare. In the relaxed \u0093ride it out\u0094 position my eyes are level with the bottom of the tank and the water's surface is roughly 20 inches above them.\r\n\n\n\nSound:\r\n\n\n\nHaving had a frightening but wonderfully comforting DMT experience involving a very familiar movie, I elected to forgo any recognizable outside audio. The only thing to be heard was the sound of the turtle tank's gentle waterfall and the occasional car outside.\r\n\n\n\nDose Prep:\r\n\n\n\nI wound a thin strip of day-glo orange duct tape around the stem of my favorite cheap bubbler, to remind me that I would now contain DMT residue forevermore. Into the bowl I placed a wire screen and added an amount of cannabis I could easily smoke (and would probably be dissatisfied with) in 1 hit. From my supply of DMT, which is so close to white you hardly notice it isn't, I raked out a loose pile about the size of a dime. That is to say, all the DMT I put in the pipe this night would have fit INSIDE an American dime. I then added about the same amount of ganja as went on the screen and compressed the mixture lightly. One more pinch of cannabis and more light pressure completed the preparation of my chemical rocketship. By eyeball, I could easily smoke this amount of just cannabis in 3 hits or less. Regretfully, I do not have a 0.001g scale, so I can only estimate the empirical weight of this dose by comparing it visually to a weigh-able supply. I estimate (Very Approximately!) that I used at most ~25mg\r\n\n\n\nCompanion:\r\n\n\n\nOnly my Red-Eared Slider turtle will remain in \u0093normal space\u0094 to watch my physical body, which I will soon be unconcerned with. His name is Hiram, and I have known him for 3 years. I found him in a pet store when he was an inch too small to be legally sold in America and all the other turtles picked on him. I felt sorry for him, but they wouldn't sell him to me, so I bribed an employee to list him on the \u0093dead animals write-off sheet\u0094 and give him to me. I know he's only a reptile, but he does recognize me (as opposed to someone who doesn't regularly give him food) and sometimes I swear he knows and is thankful that I saved him from all those big mean guys at the pet store. I take care of him, and he takes care of me.\r\n\n\n\nMental State (Prior to dose):\r\n\n\n\nI am apprehensive. This is to be my first solitary dose since what I call my \u0093Frantic Gathering & Retreat!\u0094 trip. 2 things calm my mind: Hiram will be watching me this time, and I am taking an equivalent volume [not weight, probably] of a much purer product. I recline comfortably on my bag, holding my bubbler and clearing my mind. Breathing deeply, I recall the pure child-like joy I felt last time I did this when I realized I had survived. I am excited to catch another glimpse of the \u0093entities\u0094 that looked directly at me 2 days ago and decided I wasn't ready to be spoken to. I am fearful of underestimating my dose, whether by purity, weight, or residue left in the bubbler from earlier DMT uses. Breathing all these fears and expectations out as a putrid chartreuse vapor with a final deep breath, I strike my lighter and begin to inhale.\r\n\n\n\nDosing:\r\n\n\n\nI light 1/3 of the bowl's surface quickly and pull gently to allow the heat in the bowl to vaporize the DMT, as opposed to the heat from the lighter. By the time my lungs were full the first time, the cherry had traveled across the bowl in an odd way. I attribute this to the fact that the bowl was actually a parfait of different substances, with different combustion temperatures. I hold this first hit for a long time. It has the classic \u0093Tryptamine Taste\u0094 which is like nothing else. To me, it tastes and smells like fresh aquarium tubing, but that is just the reference point for my brainwaves.\r\n\n\n\nBy the time I exhaled I was beginning to feel a.....buzzing?......around the bridge of my nose and my sinuses. Knowing I was coming up already I strove to smoke as much as I could. I was considerably more aggressive with the lighter on the second hit, and probably more aggressive with my inhalation. Fear took over again at this point as I thought, \u0093What have I done to myself?\u0094 and I exhaled much sooner than I could have. Looking at the bowl I realized that it looked only about half smoked. I may or may not have hit it a 3rd time in a halfhearted way. I remember leaning forward to set the bubbler in a safe place, and as I leaned back to settle into my beanbag the \u0093universe dissolved into everythingness\u0094 [phrase taken directly from my notes, and this is still the best way I can describe it]\r\n\n\n\nComing Up:\r\n\n\n\nComing up on DMT is powerful and terrifying for me. My first cue that something is different is a.....buzzing?...... that I feel in the middle of my face and a taste of DMT that is not quite taste; I'm pretty sure I would taste it even if it was injected. Then the mucous membranes in my mouth and throat make themselves known to me. The best way I can describe it is that I can feel diamond-shaped crystals ~1cm across forming and dissolving all over anything in my head that touches saliva. This is intensely pleasurable in an odd, alien sort of way. Again I think, \u0093What have I done to myself?\u0094 and breathe deeply once or twice. The feeling of air filling my lungs (They really are just 2 spongy balloons!!! I marvel to myself) is spectacular, and reminds me that I am still alive. I imagine that what I am experiencing now is the psychic equivalent of what Astronauts experience during lift-off. The sounds that break my concentration on my body are distorted, as though the soundwaves were electronically stretched into infinity. I am mildly aware of my surroundings as I set my bubbler down; the turtle tank and stand is in front of me, black-light to my left, and hallway to my right, and suddenly all of that disappears. Perhaps I closed my eyes, but I do not remember doing so.\r\n\n\n\nPeak:\r\n\n\n\nI find myself looking down from great height on a house at night. I hear music; it sounds [and feels and smells and tastes] like Howard Shore's \u0093Shire Theme\u0094 from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, but infinitely more complex. I have come to realize that \u0093hear\u0094 is not the proper verb here... Perhaps \u0093experience\u0094 is better, as I was aware that my physical \u0093ears\u0094 had nothing to do with this music. As soon as I become aware of this music (and even while I am still making the LOTR and non-heard connections) my perspective begins to change as though I were falling, though I feel no sensation of free-fall.\r\n\n\n\nSoon I find myself looking at the house I grew up in, from a vantage point of 10 feet from the property line and 15 feet up. The music swells to a dynamic peak and I think, \u0093I'M HOME!\u0094 I feel a sense of homecoming like nothing I've ever felt before, like when you return to a beloved child-hood haunt years after your last visit, but magnified 10 times. Even though it is night in this vision, the entire landscape is colored in reds, greens, and golds; the same colors that I see when I close my eyes and press on them.\r\n\n\n\nI become aware of the turtle tank in front of me, and watch Hiram dive from the surface 30 degrees to my right, all the way to eye level directly in front of me. I am comforted by the fact that Hiram is looking right at me, though I can't decide if his tank looks like it is made of fractals or is an impressionistic painting. Whether Fractals or Monet, I decide it is among the top 5 most beautiful sights I have ever seen. NOTHING else in my relatively well lit surroundings enters my awareness.\r\n\n\n\nSuddenly I am viewing the same scene of my child-hood home again. It looks like a photograph except for the red, green, and gold color palette. I begin to realize that *something* is off about this image... Nothing specific, just a sense that I am seeing an imperfect image. I came to realize days later that it was as though every angle was perfect in the 3 dimensions that we normally see, but 90 degrees \u0093off\u0094 in a dimension we don't. [Carl H. Claudy's \u0093The Land of No Shadow\u0094 from 1933 and A. Square's \u0093Flatland\u0094 from 1884 really shaped this viewpoint; read them if you really want to understand what I mean.]\r\n\n\n\nComing Down:\r\n\n\n\nAgain I become aware of the turtle tank, and again view the exact same image of Hiram diving from the surface 30 degrees right to eye level directly in front of me. I feel a powerful Deja Vu, and then the realization that this must be a shadow of the \u0093cycles\u0094 that my brother Franklin experiences while on DMT. I know that my eyes are open, because I am seeing Hiram, but investigation reveals that sober eyes can see much more of my apartment under identical lighting conditions. I can only conclude that the DMT caused a tunnel-vision effect, lending support to the hypothesis that endogenous [produced in the body] DMT plays a role in Near Death Experiences.\r\n\n\n\nAt this point, the image of Hiram was overlaid with my childhood home. As the internal music swelled to another dynamic peak, I could see both places at the same time, but only for a split second. In that moment, I felt as though I was looking in all directions at once. In front of me was the turtle tank/home image. All other directions (left, right, behind, up, down, forward in time, backward in time, and a host of others I understood then but not anymore) appear to be dark and sinister but not frightening tunnels crafted of incomprehensible red and gold calculus equations stretching into infinity.\r\n\n\n\nMy vision shifted briefly to a view of myself and the turtle tank from the same perspective I had seen my child-hood home, behind and above my body. I \u0093felt/saw/heard/tasted\u0094 myself and everything else in my apartment as it fell from the sky and into it's proper place. Specifically I remember watching my refrigerator and dishwasher fall from a great height, gradually changing from spinning calculus equations to mundane appliances.\r\n\n\n\nThe walls behind the turtle tank and to the left [which a sober eye can see in perfect detail] become apparent to me for the first time since I dosed as greenish [again the same green my inner eye sees when I push on my closed eyes] suggestions of walls. I am beginning to realize that I am right where I left myself, but am not really aware of my body, except that breathing still feels GREAT! I watch Hiram make a 3rd identical dive to check on me and thank him for watching my body.\r\n\n\n\nTurning my head for the first time since I dosed, I catch a glimpse of the certificate I have mounted on my wall. My rational mind knows that it is just a piece of paper which gives me the legal right to perform weddings and such, but my chemically altered mind sees a presence within it. I experienced a moment of greeting and farewell, \u0093Hello! I'm/We're so glad you're here and you found me/us and aren't scared this time! We/I were right here the whole time, right where I/we have always been! Please come back and see us/me again some time!\u0094 The emotion [and I use the word \u0093emotion\u0094 VERY loosely] I feel from this \u0093entity\u0094 at that moment is similar to the thrill and joy I felt as a child when I was found while playing hide-and-seek.\r\n\n\n\nReturning to Baseline:\r\n\n\n\nFilling my lungs continues to be a wonderful sensation. It reminds me that I survived and that feels GREAT! I am close enough to reality now that I can see my apartment again. The colors are nearly normal, except for the suggestions of red, green, and gold calculus equations swimming on all the surfaces. I can concentrate on one object and view it as \u0093normal\u0094 but everything else swims with calculus. This is rather enjoyable, and I groove for a while on the mild visuals that are somehow more real than LSD or mushroom visuals before I realize something.\r\n\n\n\nI was back home! But hadn't I just been HOME? How could I be home from HOME?!?! This was mildly confusing until my brain put it together this way the next day: \u0093I was back home from HOME, and yet I had never physically left my home.\u0094\r\n\n\n\nI wandered around my apartment for a few minutes, looking at things, touching things, experiencing the real world again. Everything seemed amazing and new, though it was the same old mess I left less than half an hour ago. Eventually I was seized by a desire to write and grabbed my notebook to record the outline that would eventually become this experience report. In retrospect I probably \u0093wasted\u0094 a good portion of my after-effects by attempting to document too soon, but this is ok because I felt my memory of the early experience slipping away.\r\n\n\n\nNotes:\r\n\n\n\nI have tried to put this experience into some sort of chronological order to make it easy to read. In reality this is a distortion of the experience, as I had no sense of \u0093time\u0094 as it was going on. In fact, everything from the end of the \u0093Coming Up\u0094 section to the end of the \u0093Coming Down\u0094 section should be considered to have happened all at the same time. It is only through several weeks of thinking and analysis of the \u0093cycles\u0094 I seemed to experience that I was able to approximate a timeline for this. Truthfully, the experience was not nearly so linear as this report makes it out to be.\r\n\n\n\nEven though I survived this experience without lasting damage, I do not recommend smoking DMT alone. My brother Franklin has this to say about the solo DMT experience: \u0093I worry about my physical body too much to do DMT without somebody watching it. It feels as though my body pulls my awareness back from hyperspace to check on it if I know it is alone.\u0094 I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment. An aquatic reptile is not a responsible substitute for a human guide.\r\n\n\n\nI relived this experience often in the weeks that followed. Looking at microorganisms in fresh pond water under a microscope nearly caused an embarrassing flashback, and I know I heard the music many times. In the end, it took me nearly a week to shake off the schizophrenic feeling of existing in 2 worlds at the same time.\r\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\r\n\n\n\nFor me, DMT is incredibly rough coming up but ridiculously gentle coming down. Imagine what an ant might feel if taken by a scientist and launched into the sky in a model rocket, to be returned safely on a parachute to the exact point where she left her ant-hill. Her world and all her reference points are momentarily destroyed, only to find herself in the same place half an hour later. Translate this into psychedelic terms and you will begin to understand the DMT experience as I experience it.\r\n\n\n\nI shift between past and present tense often. I feel like it shows how much of this experience is direct memory (present tense) vs. memories that I seemed to recall(past tense) while documenting after the experience. I find it an interesting literary device, but it's against \u0093the rules\u0094 of coherent writing."

        "report_text": "[Note: For about a month before this experience, I was taking 200mg Sertraline (Zoloft) once daily. I discontinued use 36 hours before the experience.]\r\n\n\n\nAt five o\u0092clock in the afternoon we were sitting around a friend\u0092s living room with a respectable quantity of DMT and LSD. It was my first experiment with DMT, though I\u0092d been on high doses of LSD, salvia and mushrooms before.\r\n\n\n\nThe first hit of the DMT that I did made me feel cold and weird and gave me tunnel vision. I did a second hit and held it in for some time. I felt myself melting into the couch and my head lolled to the side, the room around me fracturing into twisting pinwheels of rainbow-colored light before my eyelids drooped shut. I panicked a bit at first because the stuff was so strong that I couldn\u0092t control my body, but soon enough my ego completely flatlined, taking my worries with it.\r\n\n\n\nI didn\u0092t know or care who or where I was. Before me was a huge carousel of somberly shaded purple, grey and blue lights. I seemed to hover nearer and further away from it. When I began coming back, the room was swirling in a twisting vortex of multicolored light. Spiritual sensations and ideation were completely absent from the trip. These would come soon enough, though.\r\n\n\n\nFor some minutes afterward, I felt a euphoric lift. It was now about 6 in the evening and, with both my best friend and myself having smoked a dose of DMT each, we decided to drop the first hit of acid. We each dropped a second hit about fifteen minutes afterward.\r\n\n\n\nBy 8 o\u0092clock the acid began to peak. My trip centered around patterns in perceptual streams (much like the last time I did acid), and I meditated about layers of depersonalized intentions behind perceptions for hours, often losing entire grasp of who I was as the room around me twisted, shivered and swelled into patches of rainbows. I began to feel that the LSD had initiated some sort of autodeconstructive process in the stream of perceptions constituting my identity. This was somewhat frightening, but also exhilarating as I began to realize what it meant for our whole universe to be reflected in electrochemical interactions between cells, which could then be reconfigured in a way that temporarily altered the fabric of the universe. Pretty standard stuff for LSD use. My trip felt very material, except at times when I would feel strange creeping flows of spiritual energy slither through the room. I managed to write the following at 10:19 that night, while the peak was still going strong and my ego was totally gone:\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0093To chronicle the cognitive distortions during an LSD peak requires the utmost concentration and focus. Because the acid-smattering, weirdo-collision universe is out there, and my thoughts don\u0092t know where I am when I\u0092m thinking them.\r\n\n\n\nThe body is strangely alienated from me, as well as my cognitive processes, some of which twist into crystal fractal dimensions very far away from where they started. That\u0092s the beauty of LSD\u0097the surprises. I reach out from behind the corner and frighten myself, or catch myself catching myself catching myself\u0085\r\n\n\n\nThe sensorium is obviously broken or dislocated somehow\u0097disarticulated. But it\u0092s the resulting logical fragments that are truly terrifying. The most bizarre and interesting aspect of being on acid is that the sensorium has been totally disarticulated and reconfigured\u0097I don\u0092t know where sights, sounds, feelings etc. begin or end, and I begin or end in these data flows, losing myself in tides of beautiful colors and profoundly, sadly incommunicable emotions. Some of the phenomena of my consciousness seem stereotypical and weirdly trite\u0097it allows me to see the tides of media corruption cartoony weirdness creeping as a constant undercurrent in my thinking.\r\n\n\n\nIt\u0092s that multicolored stew, underlying all perceptions\u0097making them swirl together. When the flows of sensation become interrupted, patterns emerge in them that reveal intentions that are not my own. That\u0092s the origin of empathy. The problem of empathy is really what I\u0092m after, isn\u0092t it? The problem of empathy with things that aren\u0092t me. The whole wide, wide material universe isn\u0092t me. That\u0092s the central thing that most people can\u0092t grasp. The absolute, horrifying, endlessly multivarious and splentrificalifying multiweirdoverse.\r\n\n\n\nThe profound sadness of realizing there\u0092s nothing there to realize\u0097that\u0092s why I do hallucinogens. A perverse sort of jadedness with all sensory and emotional input. Because in striving for an absolutely different sensation, I lose track of what I am. In trying to realize there\u0092s nothing to realize, something interferes between the realizer and the abstract, happening of eventoweirdliness. There\u0092s a process trying to deconstruct itself\u0097a pattern that emerges in the conscious flow of perception, and then catches itself\u0097trying to realize what it is, but in viewing itself it unwinds again into strangeliness.\r\n\n\n\nIt takes LSD to realize the true nightmare horror strangeliness of perceptions piecing and stitching themselves into the pattern of a person, which is always endlessly re-echoed in electrochemical reactions that splinter apart and break up and reconfigure the thing that thought it was thinking about them.\r\n\n\n\nThere are levels of impersonality and automatism. Personality isn\u0092t simply an on/off switch. When I turn off the light of the ego identity, the perceptions can take on their own logic, and re-echo endlessly. It takes LSD to realize the profound sadness of our whole universe being merely electrochemical states that are disrupted. But of course that simple mechanism is inadequate, for LSD also reveals that there is something pulling the strings. That\u0092s what I try not to remember that the acid is telling me: that something is pulling the strings of my perceptions that isn\u0092t me.\r\n\n\n\nThere are multiple not mes, in fact an endlessly re-echoing not me. That\u0092s all the material universe really is\u0097a place where I am not. I can grasp then the really startlingly simple correspondences that German idealism is trying to grapple with\u0097the perceptions autodeconstruct themselves in an endlessly, byzantinely complex fashion\u0097when they begin trying to realize what they are, they initiate a series of logical states that takes over the show and the syntax of the sentence, obviously. That\u0092s probably another problem with LSD\u0097the linguistic faculties are all fucked up too, and they\u0092re trying to reveal these endlessly complex perceptual processes with nothing really behind them.\r\n\n\n\nOne thing that\u0092s interesting about the LSD is that it makes certain reaches of thought, certain images, certain lines of self that aren\u0092t normally privileged, come alive. The self begins to figure out that all consciousness is a matter of puppetry, layers upon layers of perceptions and automatism coordinating the perceptions, with nothing at the core. There\u0092s a fundamental mismatch at the core. And then the glitch just plays itself out with a tragically necessary logic. That\u0092s what a human personality is\u0097culture pulling the strings, and making the perceptions dance in a way that convinces most people there\u0092s a semblance of a person there. But really there\u0092s nothing.\r\n\n\n\nAnd one begins to figure out the cavernous emptiness of the universe when it becomes unclear whether it\u0092s contained inside the skull or not. Perhaps it could never be contained in a human skull. These things were never meant for these poor, blind, ugly organic beings, on this rock in the middle of so much, so much, unending nothingificating unconsciousness\u0097the oddity of the oddverse that isn\u0092t so much me anymore. Revealing that so much of human personality is just this tragically simple game, of here\u0092s the thing, now take it away.\r\n\n\n\nOnce I begin to realize how frightening it is that the endless, multivarious complexity of the material universe could be echoed in anything. When I begin to think that what is reflecting the endless complexity of the material universe isn\u0092t a mirror or an unbroken surface of water, but this blind labyrinth of cells firing action potentials in the darkness of something\u0092s skull on a rock that no one can see except for the seers of the rock\u0097the rest of the universe is a blind, staring, undark light. No wonder these patterns of consciousness can never pull themselves together. That\u0092s what styles do\u0097they string perceptions together into a self. But normally the unconscious is there, it\u0092s a tape of weird unprocessable thoughts, sense data, etc. What about all that SENSE DATA my brain is excluding? Those populations of neurons are making decisions about what to show me and what not to show me that are separate from the phenomena of volition. But the LSD reveals how frightening it is to have such a muddy medium be the reflecting mirror for such a complex darkness.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the acid had lost just enough intensity for us to realize where we were and what we were doing, we decided to smoke the rest of the DMT. We loaded another dose into one of the pipes we\u0092d been smoking out of before and began to inhale. It didn\u0092t take me long to blast off. The first few times we hit the pipe were almost too bewildering to recall, but afterward I began to see huge grids of rainbow light twisting and warping like a film of oil on the surface of a puddle of water. This began to subside, and then one of my friends informed us that he could scrape together a bowl of pot resin. We placed this in the bowl of a bong we\u0092d been smoking DMT out of earlier and inhaled.\r\n\n\n\nThe pot resin mixed with the DMT and began to get us incredibly high. We couldn\u0092t even feel the THC at first, as we were sucking in so much DMT. However, I feel that the THC complemented the LSD and the DMT, making the perceptual phenomena generated by both chemicals gel somehow. The first times I smoked the DMT on the acid, the chemicals seemed to clash, with the DMT overtaking the LSD. It took the pot to bind the hallucinogenic sensorium together into a coherent world.\r\n\n\n\nAfter lazing around on couches and smoking DMT and pot for about an hour, my eyes drifted shut and I began to see incredibly complex prismatic entities: Mayan gods shaped like stone fish with mouths opening and spewing out clouds of single-cell organisms, lizards, comets, clouds, multitudes of anteaters drooping down the sides of a cliff, the canopy of a rain forest at night seen from below, as if I were lying on the ground, splitting into kaleidoscopic reflections of itself in drops of water which wriggled into the shapes of frogs. My whole body would fragment, shattering into furry mammals and snakes which would scamper and slither into the undergrowth. At other times my arms and legs twisted into vines, tree limbs and roots.\r\n\n\n\nMost of the imagery I saw was incredibly complex, constantly shifting and interlacing like Gothic foliation, but made up of tropical vines, galaxies and molecules. Sometimes this imagery would turn into patterns like those in Aztec or Mayan architecture. I began to feel my soul being flooded with spiritual energy. My mind blossomed into a huge ornate temple, and images of various unrecognizable gods danced through it. I placed my hands together and held them over my head to direct a blasting column of light into my skull. At other times, everything around me swirled into rainbow storms of birds and insects that looked like a cross between moths and the leaves and tendrils of exotic plants. Often I saw myself floating above clouds and mountaintops alongside bizarrely animalistic spiritual beings. Sometimes the DMT would take memories of experiences I'd had and twist them into its landscapes or populate them with animals and gods. I couldn\u0092t open my eyes and kept repeating to my friends that I\u0092d entered a visionary state.\r\n\n\n\nAt this point, more people arrived at the house and I escaped to my friend\u0092s bedroom in order to commune with the DMT in solitude. I turned off the lights, laid down on the bed, put on some headphones and listened to Coil\u0092s ...and the ambulance died in his arms. For a while I merely lay there wondering at the incredible beauty of the closed-eye visuals. Suddenly, without noticing the transition, I found myself in the midst of a spiritual breakthrough. Here\u0092s an account I wrote immediately after the experience at 2:33 in the morning, while the euphoria and perceptual distortions were still going strong:\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0093At a certain point in the trip, I realized that I wasn\u0092t an individual anymore. There was something else, that told me that it was all things, all people, all identities. It told me that it could wear our perceptions like masks. It asked me \u0093how could I ever think of myself as being separate from all that manifold complexity?\u0094 I saw huge, spiraling, churning rows of heads, human, animal, stone\u0097and the thing was chasing itself all through them, churning them up, stirring up perceptions into people. This thing showed me, made me feel that my whole identity was nothing more than an empty mask to it, unless it chose to inhabit that mask with beautiful complexity.\r\n\n\n\nIt then made me feel that inside my mind itself was so much complexity, that the complexity of those perceptions mirrored, made room for, etched in limned and sanctified all the animal heads, the dancing whirling world, the prismatic voids, threatening to shatter human minds, to show them what they\u0092re worth, that their most intimate contents are nothing more than playthings to something much vaster. It then left me, churning into other waves of images and patterns that the DMT had left me with. I kept asking 'What are you?' but it didn\u0092t answer\u0097it seemed as if it almost laughed at the impudence of the question.\r\n\n\n\n[Later that night, I also felt that inside my head was an infinite number of beings, that the complexity of my perceptions and the colonial nature of my own consciousness united me with other beings as well as separating me from them. It was always a mistake to view that complexity as a barrier rather than a bridge.]\r\n\n\n\nAlso this thing was asking me why I denied the spiritual structure of material reality. It then showed me an extra dimension of reality, which was made of interlacing patterns uniting all beings. This spiritual reality was supported by pillars of light, complex patterns of stone and animal heads, and the entity pressed my head into one of these pillars and asked me why I didn\u0092t believe, and my mind was flooded with interlacing imagery. I understood then that I was united with all things. These patterns, these interlacing patterns [the ones generated by the DMT], they froth up the boundaries between entities and tangle them together.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heads were all stretched out in a row which curved as if it were the crest of a wave or the slope of a hill. They seemed almost like graves or monuments. The entity that I encountered wasn\u0092t itself visible; I could only glimpse it in the ripples it left as it moved through twisting, churning webs of light. I understood that the complexity of the perceptions in me was what united me with all things; I was merely one stream in an endlessly intertwining river of perceptual streams. I kept repeating to myself \u0093I am many things.\u0094 Knowing that even in myself the perceptions of a multitude of different entities were churning together in a little whirlpool of a human mind seemed to unite me with the endless complexity of the universe.\r\n\n\n\nThe spiritual reality I witnessed was made of fractal patterns of animals and plants that twisted together and interlaced between all objects, both organic and inorganic. It was a huge, warping, prismatic fabric that wove the universe together. Certain parts of this fabric thickened into towering pillars shot through with intensely glowing bluish light. It was one of these pillars that the entity held my head against, and the zig-zagging animal patterns that danced across it tangled together and crept into my thoughts, destroying the boundaries between my own identity and the rest of the universe.\r\n\n\n\nAfter this point in the trip, I felt more spiritually energized than ever before in my life. It was only later in the morning that I began to worry I\u0092d seen things that no human being had seen and broken my head for good (always a sign of a great trip). I decided to see if I could sleep it off and surprisingly had very little trouble getting to bed. When I woke up seven hours later, I was a little foggy and disoriented and I had a bit of a headache, but otherwise I was fine. Within 24 hours of the experience, I no longer noticed any aftereffects. All in all, this was certainly the most intense experience of my life and perhaps the most beautiful as well."

        "report_text": "I am always interested to know of a user\u0092s background before reading about his experience so I shall briefly give mine. I am educated to postgraduate level and have a higher professional background. Around three years ago, I began to study Buddhism and went on a number of retreats, including a Vipassana retreat. The insight from Vipassana showed me that the division between what is a drug and what is not is arbitrary and flawed; since all experience has the capacity to lead to attachment and/or aversion and since all experience is generally perceived as \u0093pleasant\u0094 or \u0093unpleasant\u0094 due to a physical sensation coupled with a change in neurotransmitter levels, all experience in the physical world has a similar action to drugs. It would be completely wrong to say that Vipassana led me to drugs; rather, it showed me that my prior reasons for not experimenting with drugs were unfounded. One reason was fear of my own reactions \u0096 what I realised, following Vipassana, was that I need not fear any \u0093difficult\u0094 drug experiences as I would be able to observe the drug\u0092s effects rather than acting out the script that the drug has written. The other reason was that drugs are \u0093not real\u0094 \u0096 a drug experience may not be real, in that it is transient and impermanent but it is no less real than any other daily experience.\r\n\n\n\nUp to my completion of this Vipassana retreat, the drugs I took were limited to alcohol and tobacco. I had tried hashish a few times and cocaine once and was quite unimpressed with both so felt no desire to experiment with them further; put another way, I couldn\u0092t see what all the fuss was about. Shortly after completing Vipassana I had my first experience with MDMA and since then I have also experimented with MDEA, Marijuana, LSD, Amphetamine, Nitrous Oxide, Methamphetamine, Ketamine, Psilocybin Mushrooms and Salvia Divinorum (and combinations of all of the above). Of all of these drugs, I take MDMA and LSD most frequently (at least two or three times per month and often more regularly). I occasionally smoke tobacco, I take caffeinated drinks in moderation and rarely drink alcohol.\r\n\n\n\nIn light of the foregoing, I think it fair to say I have had broad experience with recreational drugs. I have never had a \u0093bad trip\u0094 even when I have taken doses of LSD that could be described as \u0093heroic\u0094. With all this, I think the most important thing I can say about DMT is that nothing, no amount or combination of drugs and no amount of description could ever have prepared me for how completely mind-blowing this substance is. DMT divides the brain by zero, which is impossible (except with DMT).\r\n\n\n\nI prepared a bed of ashes in a bong by burning some tobacco; I then compacted the ashes and put a small amount of pure DMT salt on top of the ashes. I held the flame to the salt as I inhaled, making sure all of it vaporised. I held in the smoke for around 10 seconds. There was some smoke left in the bong but, as I breathed out the smoke I had inhaled, the effects of the drug had already overwhelmed my ability to move (I expected this) so I put down the bong. I sat back in the couch as there was nothing else I could do.\r\n\n\n\nPhysically, I was very aware of my body (it felt enormous) but also it seemed as if my sense of touch extended into my surroundings (my study). Everything shook and shimmered and suddenly the visuals became something that can only be described as hi-tech. Colours shone with a brilliance I had never seen. Hi-tech shapes, that suggested intelligent design, flowed over the view of everything, but unlike the phosphenes I see with LSD (which seem as if they are coming from behind my eye), this imagery was in front of me \u0096 I was witnessing something external to my body rather than through a filter. As I turned my head, all images from different points of view combined, past, present and future (maybe 10 seconds each way) by layer upon layer of translucent images, pulsating and animated with an intelligence that defies verbal description. Even though all colours were amplified and vivid, I noticed that there was a great deal of tranluscent gold and neon green colour in all of my field of vision but again, this seemed like something I was looking at rather than tinted glasses over my eyes.\r\n\n\n\nI felt a presence, very powerful. Some have described this presence as their former self (as in from the prior moment) and that perceiving the former self as another being (which, in a way it is) is the explanation for this presence. I did feel this \u0093echo\u0094 of myself (the self, or what we think of it as being, is of course transient and impermanent) but there was definitely something else. It seemed as if hundreds, thousands, perhaps millions of beings, were present, all in a hive of communication. I was aware of them but I cannot say for certain whether they were aware of me.\r\n\n\n\nThe intensity of everything was, in a sense, terrifying. I wasn\u0092t really scared of anything, if only because I knew that nobody has ever (at least according to any reliable source) died from smoking DMT. If I didn\u0092t know this, I might have been worried but since I am always well informed of the medical effects of a drug before taking it, I am never worried. The amount of information storming by brain and the processes working were incredible and, if I were a computer, I would be afraid that my CPU would be fried as a result of overclocking. So much was happening that I might never be able to make sense of. My initial, split-second neurotic reaction to the intensity was a predictable \u0091I\u0092m never doing this again\u0092, however, I knew that such thoughts always pass if I allow them to just pass, rather than clinging to them or trying to push it away; the thought arises by itself, without my input \u0096 it will leave of its own volition! I find this easy to do because I meditate. Furthermore, I recalled that my first reaction to Salvia was similar and passed, giving way to something amazing and enlightening; I saw no reason for that not to happen with DMT.\r\n\n\n\nAudio was interesting. The music that was playing was both amplified and quieter all at once \u0096 which, again, is impossible (except with DMT). There was a slight drop in pitch and tempo, oscillating up sometimes. Everything echoed as if the same sound came from different sources, near and far. Other sounds were also heard; I still have no idea what they were but I certainly did not find them objectionable. The visions I had pulsated in time to the music that was playing, although I only realised that this had happened on retrospect.\r\n\n\n\nTaste and smell were best not paid too much attention, if only because of the disgusting, caustic taste of the DMT smoke and its matching smell. So much is happening that it would be great shame to allow it to detract from the experience. Like the slight nausea that can follow ingestion of psilocybin mushrooms, it really is a very small price to pay and I am grateful for the experience rather than whining like a small child over a mildly uncomfortable side effect. A few times I did cough, not repeatedly but one loud cough at a time \u0096 this acted as a release of some built-up energy (not so much release of tension but more release of an arrow from a bow, clearly directed) but also amplified the experience and it felt as if my lungs shook the entire universe, a most powerful sensation.\r\n\n\n\nAs for breathing generally, I took deliberately deep breaths, if only to make sure I was breathing. I realised that this was unnecessary and of course that nobody has ever choked or died from asphyxiation as a result of smoking DMT. Perhaps the fact that the past, present and future are blended together with DMT accounts for this odd sensation of not being sure of whether or not I am breathing. It is as if I become aware of my immediately prior exhalation as I am inhaling. I think it was this, rather than the layered images, that made me realise that my sense of time was greatly stretched. I am aware of the passage of time (perhaps I might not be so aware of it without music as a reference) but time definitely becomes more flexible.\r\n\n\n\nThe description of the experience with reference to different senses cannot account for the intense synaesthesia. I can say that I tasted music, saw colours etc., all of which is true but really is beyond description. During the peak effects (which lasted all of 5-10 minutes but felt like forever and never), all I could do is lie back into my chair and let things happen. I did not try to move much and was probably not capable of doing so.\r\n\n\n\nOnce the peak visual effects subsided a little, I laughed inwardly for a minute before deciding to stand up and walk around. Everything shimmered and radiated and it was as if I were moving through a gaseous formation such as a pulsar, through a galaxy. I turned around and looked at my (ugly) floral pattern upholstered couch and the flowers were literally moving from one cushion to the other and onto the floor and into the air. I could \u0093control\u0094 the flow of these flowers by moving my hands. Music at this point became exceptionally pleasant, more pleasant even than music on MDMA or LSD or both. I did what I usually like to do when under the influence of psychedelics and stare at myself in the mirror. I had a divine glow but what I find most remarkable was that I didn\u0092t look like I was on drugs. With all other drugs, I will have a certain look that those who do not use drugs might not detect but I will notice. With DMT, this was not the case.\r\n\n\n\nAs visuals died away, a strong euphoria lingered; I shivered and clung to the wall, my body pulsating with bliss. There was almost a sense of relief or perhaps as if I had been awarded a prize, as if I had come through a major trial successfully. Over the next 20 minutes or so the effects of the drug wore off, leaving a wonderful afterglow. I found it difficult however to make sense of what had happened and so decided after about half an hour to have another, milder trip. This trip is not worthy of too much mention as, while intense in comparison with other substances, was nothing like the first trip and no use in integrating the first.\r\n\n\n\nI waited an hour and had another full dose. The effects were similar to the first trip except more intense and once the peak visual effects eased, it gave way to what I must say is the purest euphoria I have ever experienced. It was this trip that enabled me to make sense of the first and allowed me to explain it here.\r\n\n\n\nLater on in the day a friend called around. He was keen to try DMT but wanted to watch how I behaved on it first. I was also interested to see would the trip be different with somebody present; I can\u0092t say that it was a whole lot. His face looked very warm and friendly (he is very warm and friendly, so that was hardly surprising) but he didn\u0092t fit in the \u0093alternative\u0094 universe I was seeing. I had more of a sensation of flying this time than the previous three times \u0096 unfortunately for readers, whatever I was flying through really defies description, except I felt a very strong presence of intelligence and numerous beings of unknown nature. As I was coming to, my friend took a dose. He seemed very shocked by the effects of the drug and as he came to said that he probably would not take DMT again, not because it was \u0093bad\u0094 but simply \u0093too weird\u0094. Interestingly, he found the music playing (and the few words I spoke, nothing significant) very \u0093raw\u0094 and almost grating. Like myself, he practises Vipassana and said that, had he not been on a Vipassana retreat, the experience would have been disastrous and would have scarred him. Predictably, fifteen minutes after saying this, he said he would definitely have to try DMT again. He noted that he felt a calm like he had never felt; I asked him if this was like a \u0093system reset\u0094 (or perhaps a \u0093clean installation\u0094 of a new operating system) and he agreed. I expected that this might be his reaction \u0096 similar to the reaction of most people I have seen taking Salvia for the first time: terror or near terror followed by great joy and a desire to repeat the experience.\r\n\n\n\nThe next day, in the evening, I took another dose. I asked my wife (who was not taking DMT or any substances) if she would try to interact with me or at least observe while I was under the influence. I wasn\u0092t really able to communicate with her but what I noticed is that the \u0093beings\u0094 I encountered had similar features to her. By features I do not necessarily mean physical features \u0096 all I noted was that she \u0093belonged\u0094 among the beings whose presence I felt. The beings were aware of her and it was as if a part of her that is beep in her subconsciousness was fully aware of them also (on that note, this was the first time the unknown beings seemed aware of me and took notice).\r\n\n\n\nI have yet to establish the full significance of this; I might be able to once she takes DMT herself but she is not yet ready for it. This does corroborate the aforementioned view that one of the explanations for the sensation of a strong presence during a DMT trip is an echo of the self, perceived as a separate entity. As already stated, I do not accept this as a complete explanation and I do hold to the view that the beings I encountered were more than simply \u0093me\u0094 in the past, present and future. Given what I noticed of my wife \u0093communicating\u0094 with the DMT-universe beings, it strengthens my view that our intelligence, awareness and power as human beings is in several parts and none of the parts are aware of the other. DMT has opened up a part that what I typically see as \u0093me\u0094 was unaware of and it likewise of \u0093me\u0094. It would seem that the goal of a meditator and/or psychonaut should be to integrate these several parts so that there is continuity of awareness and intelligence.\r\n\n\n\nThe most significant integrable effect of the trip was that it has made me quite unafraid of dying. I don\u0092t want to die but I feel as if I can make good choices after my death; I cannot fully explain in words why I feel this. DMT strongly reinforced the truth that there is nothing to fear except fear itself.\r\n\n\n\nThere is a concept in Buddhism (but by no means unique to that tradition) called shunyata, that is best translated as \u0093emptiness\u0094. Meditation (especially Vipassana in a Theravadin tradition) and drugs other than DMT can take me into shunyata, into the void as it were. LSD can certainly help me to empty my mind, to the point where I have no thought, only awareness. Ketamine, Nitrous Oxide and especially Salvia take me much further into the void, to the vanishing point of the universe where everything is perceived as empty and that the universe is the modulation of a single oscillating wave that has no permanent or physical reality.\r\n\n\n\nTibetan Buddhists, however, seem to suggest that, while a student must attain this understanding of shunyata, that there is something \u0093beyond\u0094 shunyata. I cannot claim to have an understanding of what Tibetans mean by this (if this is what they are saying at all) but I can say that with DMT, I am taken beyond the void, beyond emptiness. I am always one to spot puns but, while no more than a coincidence, the sound of the letters \u0093D-M-T\u0094 seems so apt. Vipassana, LSD and dissociatives emptied my mind; DMT has de-emptied it. By this I do not mean it has undone anything. It seems that when I reach \u0093the void\u0094, I come to the vanishing point of the universe. DMT allows me to push beyond this vanishing point allowing me to see another universe that actually co-exists with this one and is right under our noses. I had always thought that I might leave the material world behind to pursue a monastic life (or at least go and live in the Himalayas for a few years); having had DMT, I no longer consider this necessary as there is nothing to leave and wherever I go in this world would not take me further to this new truth I have seen, which is right under our noses, wherever we go. Of all the effects of DMT, this is so far the most liberating.\r\n\n\n\nSubtle \u0093flashbacks\u0094 have followed; I have experienced several in the past few days (not at all difficult, unpleasant, distracting or overwhelming), which for me have helped significantly with integration.\r\n\n\n\nI want to take the experience of DMT further by undergoing a full ayahuasca ritual, as I am certain that this will make the experience easier to integrate. The reason DMT is so difficult to make sense of is of course because it hits you out of nowhere and vanishes just as quickly. Until such time as I have the opportunity to take part in an ayahuasca ritual, I intend to slowly experiment with combining DMT with other substances, especially LSD and MDMA and perhaps in time with dissociatives. I expect that I will take a long time to do this as it is certainly not something to be rushed into.\r\n\n\n\nDMT is, by a long shot, the most powerful drug (at least, as far as the mind is concerned) I have tried. Indeed, the power of all other drugs combined is completely insignificant compared to the power of DMT. Though it is true that a difficult trip on DMT might be \u0093easier\u0094 than, say LSD in that if something becomes uncomfortable, I need only endure it for five minutes as opposed to a gruelling eight hours. \r\n\n\n\nI shall close by saluting the first shamans who discovered DMT-containing plants and dared to experiment and voyage into the unknown. Their bravery, or recklessness, or both, has been for the benefit of mankind."

        "report_text": "This record is an account of my first true breakthrough experience with Dimethyltryptamine extracted from Mimosa Hostilis root bark \u0091aka Jerema.\u0092  My first DMT extraction involved shredding 1 kilogram of the root bark in a coffee grinder which yielded an off pink-purple mulch with fine powder collecting on the bottom.  This material was basified to 12 PH using Sodium Hydroxide from Roebic\u0092s Crystal Drain cleaner.  Red Devil lye had been taken off the market and this was the only available substitute I could find (Roebic appears to now be off the market as well).\r\n\n\n\nThe bark material was allowed to sit in the solution for 10 hours.  Afterward 5 extractions of non-polar Mineral Spirits were taken from the bark/sodium hydroxide solution.  A ratio of 1:10 of Mineral Spirits were added to the bark solution then shaken viperously for 5 minutes.  The two layers of non-polar and polar solvent solutions were left to sit for 30 minutes to separate.  After the solution was separated using a Turkey baser it was added to a large glass bowl.  All 5 extractions were completed in this same procedure.  Each extraction was added together leaving me with roughly 700-800ml of dark yellow liquid.  \r\n\n\n\nThis liquid was then added to a 1 gallon bag and 3-4 times the amount in water was poured into it.  The layer of non-polar solvent was then separated from the polar water solvent.  A scissor was used to cut a bottom corner of the bag to allow the water layer to drain out.  Just as the water finished draining the bag was immediately placed over another glass bowl so the non-polar solvent could flow into it.  This procedure was repeated 4 times to make sure all sodium hydroxide (water soluble) was removed from the non-polar solvent.  The yellow liquid material was then poured into a large glass baking pan and allowed to evaporate.  After a week or so the solvent had completely evaporated leaving an orange lucent wax substance which upon scraping up yielded a light sienna type tar.\r\n\n\n\nInitial trials of smoking this substance resulted in a very painful and unsettling smoke using a glass pipe.  50 mg of so created definite altered consciousness, perception, and visual distortion.  However, my lung capacity prevented me from smoking any more of this orange brown material.\r\n\n\n\nI still had 4 kilograms of Mimosa Hostilis bark sitting in the freezer.  After my disappointing extraction results I dismissed it as a source for crude DMT.  I figured the tar may be a great substitute for drinking the foul Ayahuasca tea, but was not an acceptable source of smokeable DMT.\r\n\n\n\nThe irony being after about 1 year I was cleaning out my freezer and stumbled upon one 2 kilo bag of Mimosa Hostilis bark and a second bag of finely ground 2 kg bark.  I had thought about selling it or making several Ayahuasca teas which I\u0092ve never tried due to certain medications I\u0092m taking. Either way I figured I\u0092d condense the solution down to something more storage friendly or at least make a few bucks off of it.  I then decided selling year old mimosa bark isn\u0092t fair to the buyer and decided I\u0092d do the same extraction process I had tried 1 year prior.\r\n\n\n\nI had gone through the same exact series of extractions using the polar and non-polar separations which I had utilized 1 year earlier.  However, I chose to evaporate the substance in a different setting.  Instead of evaporating outside, I stuck the dishes in a slow ventilation area in the garage.  I used two baking glass dishes because I had twice the mineral spirit material to work with.  I basically left the dishes in those cupboards for about two months.  I should note that during those two months it was the coldest time of year between december and february.  Temperatures in the garage regularly experienced highs of 50 degrees and lows of 30 degrees.  \r\n\n\n\nI had actually forgotten about the trays for a month when I went onto an entheogen forum and began looking into tryptamines.  This jolted my memory and I remembered about the trays I had forgotten.  That night I went into the garage and pulled both trays out of the cupboard.  To my surprise I noticed white bumps scattered throughout them.  They were such a pure white I almost mistaken them for some sort of freak fungal infection.  Upon further inspection I noticed these bumps looked like finely defined crystalline structures.  There was still liquid within the dishes so I poured it into a glass bowl and stuck the remaining solution into the freezer for 48 hours.  The white crystals were stuck to the dishes, there were dozens of them on average the size of a penny to a quarter.  These crystal structures were all circular and seemed to form in separate clumps. \r\n\n\n\nI scraped these up and placed them on a glass plate to dry.  In the meantime after 48 hours I checked on the glass bowl in the freezer.  Upon pulling out the bowl I noticed an immediate fuzzy film all over the sides of the bowl where the non-polar solution was present.  It looked exactly like yellow pollen with thousands of tiny yellow balls clinging to the sides of the glass dish.  The remaining liquid was poured out and this material was collected using a razor blade.  This soupy bright yellow material was then placed on a glass dish and allowed to dry.  The remaining liquid was placed back into the glass dishes and allowed to evaporate outside under much faster circumstances.\r\n\n\n\nWhat I ended up with were three separate grades of DMT.  The white crystalline \u0093bumps\u0094 as I call them seemed to be very pure DMT.  I didn\u0092t need a microscope to see the complex arrangements within the material I collected.  It turned out to be several grams which filled \u00be of a baggy which most buttons used for clothing accessories are sold within.  My theory is the slow evaporation coupled with the numerous freezing nights seemed to concentrate the chemical slowly over time.  It gradually precipitated out of the solution and yielded the most pure product.\r\n\n\n\nThe second extract was the yellow powder which was precipitated out of the freezer technique.  It was much more consistent in its distribution over the glass bowl.  Instead of seeing bumps of DMT I saw a thin 1/8th inch layer of yellow \u0093pollen\u0094 type substance coat the entire bowl.  This material I should mention was partially extracted with Xylene.  This is supposed to extract Yuremamine or \u0093jungle DMT.\u0094  This material was separated in the initial extraction phase to see if this chemical would truly be extracted.  I also used Mineral Spirits with a couple of the 'pulls.'  I saw no reddish or other bizarre colorations with the extract which I\u0092ve read have been reported.  I do believe there is some other alkaloid, possibly with MAOI characteristics which makes the Xylene extract more intense.  This yellow substance proved to be a more powerful experience then the pure crystalline \u0093bumps\u0094 I had discovered from the initial solution.\r\n\n\n\nThe evaporated waxy brown-orange material from the third final extract seems to be residual alkaloids which contain some leftover DMT.  I\u0092ve found it way to hard to smoke and have therefore saved it in the freezer as a possible future Ayahuasca analogue.\r\n\n\n\nThe first dose of DMT I administered was the initial crystalline white substance which I gave to a co-worker.  Upon initial feedback he had stated it was \u0093very clean and visual\u0094 but would not comment further.  This irritated me because I had basically used him as a guinea pig and these were the only words he could provide on the experience.  I\u0092ve noticed after repeatedly smoking DMT that memory is quite fleeting and absent.  It seems as though the brain cannot or does not want to process high doses of this compound.  The mind seems to shut down in an attempt to possibly retain any tangible essence of accessable reality.  I think the experience itself might be so profound the brain shuts itself off in order to cope with the effects which are too intense for the normal state of consciousness to bear.  It could well be a psychological barrier which the mind upholds in order to tolerate a rapidly disintegrating state of both the ego and the body.\r\n\n\n\nI vaguely remember my first experience with the first crystalline white DMT I had smoked.  I remember up-taking the compound in around 3 large tokes out of a glass pipe.  I would estimate I smoked around 60 milligrams or so of the substance.  I held the lighter about 1 inch from the pipe and let it sit for 10 seconds or so.  I then inhaled the vapor and repeated this practice three times without ever exhaling.  I had held the vapor for around 40 seconds over the course of the three hits.  I could feel the effects after roughly 20 seconds.  \r\n\n\n\nBy the exhalation of the third hit I was experiencing an incredible glowing vibration which overwhelmed my entire body.  It had no reference point and I felt as though my entire body was an integrated force.  The force was emanating from the center of my brain.  I could simultaneously experience every cell within my body which seemed to originate within the top of my mind.  Typing this now completely sober I can feel the pulse of the experience emanating from my brain.  Residual memory is my best guess.  The imprint of the experience seems to alter the ability to remember it.  The only way I can remember the experience is to recount some of it\u0092s most mild and subdued effects.  I think of past life regression of the consciousness.  In order to articulate such a bizarre experience into words my brain must restore itself to that point of origin.  Even then words are completely inadequate. \r\n\n\n\nThis is what I feel distinguishes DMT from other psychedelics of which I have consumed hundreds if not thousands of times.  When I recall a memory of an acid trip, psilocybin trip, or mescaline trip, they all feel subjective and alienated from my mind.  They are nothing more then remnant thoughts, proud, but distant from my current conscious state of mind.  They are like the alleyway of a distant exuberant and fascinating exploration into an inner-city complex to which I don\u0091t occupy.  My mind recounts the memory and experience but keeps it disconnected because it is not integrated into my everyday existence.  These psychedelics are but a lone and narrow road which my psyche may pursue every once and awhile on whim.  \r\n\n\n\nDMT is a far different beast.  It is right there in my thoughts, my dreams, my reality.  I feel it every second I\u0092m alive as I\u0092m typing this, coursing through my veins.  It is of me and part of me.  I sense it has and always will be within me till the day I die and beyond.  I only get this experience with other tryptamines or phenethylamines when I consume them.  They feel like a temporary portal into the astral realms of my subconscious.  Whenever I think about DMT or even envision it\u0092s effects on my mind I enter a sort of binding resonance with reality.  Typing this and thinking of this substance I feel as though it is effecting me now and always has been.  It is part of the complex chemical soup of my own pineal gland.  When I listen to my body it tells me what the mind is too hypersensitive to understand emotionally, unless it cuts itself off from primal sensation.  \r\n\n\n\nThe pineal gland is the manufacturing center for DMT.  It occupies the most valuable real-estate inside the brain around its center.  My question, why did we evolve to protect this gland and hold it in the most sacred place within the brain?  It occupies the most substantial Chakra point or \u0091Crown Chakra.\u0094  It is right above the cerebral pineal fluid sack which surrounds the human brain.  This suggests it is in direct proximity to upload information of possible visual and psychic nature into this organ.  The ancient Sumerians were aware of this gland, along with the french philosopher descrates, and the Egyptians.  Many of the ancient's inscriptions and cuneiforms show what looks like a pinecone adorning scepters and other religious and sacred objects.  They understood the 'pinecone' pineal gland was the vessel into incredible spiritual revelations and knowledge.\r\n\n\n\nReality is nothing more then concentrated energy condensed down to a specific 3rd dimensional vibration at an extremely slow rate.  When I focus hard enough I feel this vibration, it is most prominent when under altered states of consciousness.  Under this mild focused awareness I feel what my body truly is and always was.  Surprisingly, it feels like a weak DMT trip within a competent and coherent state of mind.  A constant vibrational glow within my physical body at probably slightly above my heart rate.  This beat probably corresponds with the Shumman frequency.  My body beats at the same resonance as the Earths.  I feel this when I\u0092m having deep thoughts about my experiences with DMT under extreme meditation.  When I imagine its presence over my psyche then I begin to feel the greater sense that I am just a beat or pulse within a greater planetary organism.  The feeling is so completely organic and fluid, I almost have panic attacks at times.  As though my heart is beating rhythmically with a force out of my control.\r\n\n\n\nThis pales in comparison to the yellow powdered freezer precipitated DMT I smoked.  That experience was much more profound and terrifying.  The irony being the terror tantalized me, making me titillated and disturbed.  The substantial thing is, I remember every single aspect in specific detail.  It is more vivid then my most vivid memories of my entire 27 years of life on this planet.  My first sexual encounter, my childhood trauma of being lost in Disneyland Anaheim, CA for 12 hours (terrorized by costumed Mickey Mouse and Goofy), and even my first experience waking up from a 2 day coma of GHB overdose which I recovered from after my vitals flat lined.  The experience I had is the most vivid memory I have ever had in my entire life.  It is more real then this reality.  So pristine in all aspects, I know it was real.  Not of this dimension, within that plane, but of another higher 4th dimensional place.  \r\n\n\n\nThis place was so vivid I know without a doubt it could not have been a hallucination or vision unless the very nature of the reality I have spent my entire life is a perpetual hallucination or vision.  This current and physical reality feels more synthetic then the chemically intertwined oneness DMT took me into within 5 minutes.  In that span of time I entered a plane of space which was so foreign and alien to my existence, it destroyed my faith in the very material existence of this reality.  It also had detrimental consequences on my belief in death and birth, which at that time simultaneously occurred in the same space.  \r\n\n\n\nThis showed me there is no birth and no death.  It is the illusion of this subjective perception of the whole consciousness creating a new memory for itself.  Think about any memory you\u0092ve ever had, it starts and it ends very abruptly after only a mater of seconds.  This is the microcosm of a fleeting experience juxtaposed onto the greater movie which is the story of your life.  All we see is the movie in action, we're never aware of what happens before or afterward in this realm.  We don\u0092t anticipate the planning, the script being written, the actors being cast.  We don\u0092t foreshadow the credits role because we simply turn off the TV prior.  We don\u0092t ask why the set is disassembled, the costumes auctioned off, the copyrights challenged in court.  We only see the parts that we want to see!  These parts are recorded in a montage fashion over the span and course of our waking reality.  \r\n\n\n\nThat description is the difference between this reality and the reality of DMT.  It shows me the past, present, and future simultaneously in one conscious state.  This is about the simplest way I can articulate what I think this compound does and is capable of on the mind.  Transporting consciousness to a state of \u0093omnipresence\u0094 which our primal brain is simply too preoccupied with the present to assimilate.\r\n\n\n\nI don\u0092t want to provide the impression that I\u0092m enlightened or endowed with esoteric knowledge the general populace is lacking, because I\u0092m not.  I\u0092m a polysubstance abuser, an alcoholic, suffer from ADHD, and chronic depression.  I am far from enlightened.  And that is the magic of DMT.  I don\u0092t have to be endowed with talents beyond the normal scope of humanity.  I don\u0092t need to have mastered Ayuradic or Vedic forms of meditation.  I care little for puloty or Yoga.  I tried them but I simply found I love to endure pain. \r\n\n\n\nI have always been attracted to bodybuilding.  A great Euphemism for life.  I destroy my body only to build it up stronger then it was before.  I love pain because I feel that through this venue only there can I grow.  The Roman Empire\u0092s Debouched hedonism has shown the excesses of pleasure leads to spiritual downfall.  DMT is a painful experience in very high doses.  It, or any other psychedelics, are not meant for most of the population as Huxley warned.  Leary made the mistake of hoping the greater populace would see some relevance to these substances without understanding humanity has an innate and outright detesting of the unknown.  \r\n\n\n\nDMT is the ultimate unknown and perhaps understandably the most cautious psychedelic which one should approach.  In many respects I am glad this substance is scheduled because I do not feel most of humanity is ready to allow their brain to accept an experience so outside of their immediate surroundings.  The majority of humanity is simply not ready for this experience.  This is why I feel it must be left in the hands of the brave and adventurous beings who are willing to risk their own sanity in order to explore the ultimate unknown, the human brain. \r\n\n\n\nI prefer Huxley\u0092s mentality in that Psychedelics should be reserved for a select few, but who decides that curriculum, standard, and access?  I believe these few discover this on their own because something has always driven them to this information.  They have always known these entheogens were meant to lead them to something beyond themselves.  This is precisely why I am here typing this information for you to read.  The curiosity which has brought you to this information is a testiment to your willingness to attempt to understand these alternate realities.\r\n\n\n\nThe other route is Leary who\u0092s blatant publication of this alternative 'psychatropic medication' helped inhibit psychiatric research of entheogens back by decades.  Advocating mass use of such powerful tools is incredibly foolish and I find premature coming from an M.D. who was caught up in the wave of popularity he had received from his association with these compounds.  \r\n\n\n\nHis Ego destroyed psychedelics in mainstream research, this is why they are chemically designed to destroy the Ego.  To prevent mass human awareness of their eye opening properties.  From personal observation, most of us are not physiologically hardwired or capable to cope with the changes these substances induce. \r\n\n\n\nI theorize these plant alkaloid compositions are a deterrent to animals developing higher organized states.  In these states these animals possessed greater potential to destroy the plant in question.  Keep the animal disoriented and confused and it will not desire to pass this information to it\u0092s siblings.  Alkaloids are a defense mechanism simultaneously terrifying and expanding reality.  To most animals, this would be perceived as a toxin within the brain, with no benefit to their immediate survival.  Hence the plant is saved from being eaten and preserves itself in order to reproduce.  Why then do human\u0092s consciously consume the toxic plants other animals disregard?\r\n\n\n\nThe more one advocates and ordains these chemical godheads the more it fuels the ego.  This is most prevelant in western society, where such chemicals give the distributor a sense of superiority by having access to a divine substance which only a few are granted.  This is the trick organized religion has used for thousands of years.  It's controllers profess to contain a knowledge and wisdom from an external source (usually god) which gives these priests, bishops, and shamans spiritual control over the population.  \r\n\n\n\nYes, primitive Shamans are just a prototype of Bishops, Priests, and disciples which Western society adopted without the heavy cultural indoctrination of psychedelic compounds.  Shamans along with priests and religious leaders fall into the trap of ego.  This is why I feel these plants place a premium on debilitating that aspect of the human mind.  The ego is what influences these teachers to withhold the knowledge and horde it for themselves.  They pass it down selectively to only a few who they feel worthy enough to possess it.  This is the ego in motion.  These elitists are revered and worshiped for this wisdom and held in elevated status.  They use these substances to wow their populations.  If one wishes to understand this very simply then ask the question \u0093Who Benefits?\u0093  \r\n\n\n\nWhen one asks this question he/she will see very clearly who has profited from the circumstances I have described.  Priests are the \u0092updated-Shamans\u0092 of the modern world.  They are there to impress their followers with the possibility of access to greater truth and knowledge.  In return they receive money, adoration, and power.  As long as they tightly hold onto this knowledge they have no fear in it reaching the masses.  This is the detriment the ego has caused on our culture and it\u0092s access to higher spiritual truths. \r\n\n\n\nThese \u0092spiritual keepers\u0092 hold the highest status and prestige of the group they occupy, containing knowledge and insight denied to the general populace.  This is say akin to the highest degrees of the freemasons who have restrained the knowledge of ancient levitation, occult ritual magic, and esoteric wisdom.  This wisdom held desperately because the few in power use the many followers ignorance to glorify and exonerate their status at the expense of their 'Sheeps\u0094 lack of hindsight.  The wolf is always herding his flock inevitablly into slaughter.  \r\n\n\n\nWhat I find interesting about DMT is it\u0092s ability to completely shatter my sense of ego and any feelings of superiority be it intellectual or physical I may think I possess.  No other entheogen has done this and \u0093told me\u0094 in ways I don\u0092t understand that I am not what I think I am or ever was.  Other chemicals may take me into another dimension of reality but never take me to \u0093another\u0094 reality.  This is exactly what is happening to my psyche while on DMT vs. other entheogens.  They take my ego to another plane where to the outsider it seems limited but is merely bypassed.  DMT takes my ego to another place so foreign and alien in nature it ceases to exist in this dimension altogether.  Such a shattering event occurs over the course of less then five minutes before I\u0092m back within the place from which I left.  \r\n\n\n\nFor reference purposes I\u0092ll describe the only other substances which has created ego death to such a drastic degree as DMT.  It is Salvia Divinorum or \u0093Diviner\u0092s Sage.\u0094  Personally I disregard Salvia and have never found any spiritual or transcendent tangible benefit from the several times I\u0092ve smoked it.  It feels alien, similar to DMT, but not integrated into my being.  It has the same sterility and muteness feeling I get from DMT.  But it lacks a sense of the only word I can describe as \u0093soul.\u0094  \r\n\n\n\nWhereas DMT feels cosmic and infinite, Salvia feels personal, internal, and entrapping to my consciousnesses point of reference.  The intensity and duration of DMT and Salvia are both startlingly similar.  Both begin within 20-30 seconds and effects end completely within 15 minutes.  Both are profound and easily the two most intense experiences I\u0092ve ever had in my life.  They seem to replicate the same alien plane of existence, however, the effects are drastically different from one another.  \r\n\n\n\nAt 1 minute into both experiences I loose complete control over my body, time has no meaning or ever did.  I could be dead or living and it wouldn\u0092t mater because those states of being hold no real effect over the conscious state which my mind is occupying.  I believe it is this point my consciousness has left 3rd dimensional dense space and accessed a lighter 4th dimensional realm.  Here anything goes, and nothing in the context of this 3rd dimensional space holds any relevance.  It\u0092s gone, there is no physical body as there is no need for one.  Consciousness doesn\u0092t seem to need a body.  In this state the body was merely a vessel to experience the consciousness which was always pervasive in all things.    \r\n\n\n\nThis is right where the similarities completely end.  DMT connects me with an all encompassing force which is present in all mater within the universe.  I am one with the infinite, the cosmic consciousness of a dozen different dimensions which all exist simultaneously.  The salvia experience is most similar to a blackout of my consciousness.  I go deep within my most primordial state.  My mind is not able to articulate any point of reference to this reality yet all of my motor skills are fully intact.  I know this happens to most people that smoke Salvia because I\u0092ve watched hundreds of videos of kids trying it on youtube.  About 30 seconds in I can see the point where these people stop laughing and hit that alternate reality.  In this state they cannot express it, but they are usually terrified, confused, and gripped with emotion which the body cannot and doesn\u0092t externally demonstrate to the observer.  I believe much of this has to due with setting, as Salvia is often a first and only time occurrence due to the experience it generates.  \r\n\n\n\nWhat I find unsettling about Salvia is it seems to take any remnant of whatever consciousness I can make reference of and \u0093unzip\u0094 it.  My mind is torn in two separate places as the drug takes it in one direction but my mind wants to go in the other.  It\u0092s an utter contradiction of planes of my psyche.  I call it the \u0093zipper effect.\u0094  I am unzipped and splitting apart, being pulled instantly in two separate directions without any control.  I wouldn\u0092t mind this state of being if I felt as though I somehow benefited from it or utilized it.  Maybe it is just me, but I can never seem to feel as though this introspective substance is connecting me to anything meaningful or psychologically usable. \r\n\n\n\nI believe Salvia and DMT are accessing the same dimensional space.  The salvia taking me to an infinite introspective collapse of the ego and reality where I am self contained.  The DMT taking me to infinite cosmic possibility where I am integrated into all matter and am all mater within the universe simultaneously.  The micro and the Macro expressing themselves in different conscious states, yet always of the same source. \r\n\n\n\nI think my primitive mammalian brain is more attracted to the DMT because of it\u0092s constant role in human metabolism and biological function.  The brain craves this substance which interestingly is one of the only to be up-taken so readily by the cerebral pineal fluid of the blood brain barrier.  Much more easily then complex Carbohydrates or proteins which must be broken down into Glucose for the brain to utilize their properties. \r\n\n\n\nSalvia is not an alkaloid and is not as easily recognizable by the human body.  This is why I believe I have a dislike of the substance.  My brain seems to utilize DMT because it knows through millions of years of evolution how to best incorporate it into my mind and body.  The salvia is foreign and new, a novelty.  Perhaps through the same evolutionary process it too will generate the \u0093missing link\u0094 to the subconscious.  I theorize the human brain isn\u0092t yet fully integrated within the individuality of conscious thought it occupies to understand the extreme interpersonal plane Salvia invokes.  We are social animals, bound and interconnected with other members of our species.  We have never been alone, isolated, and ostracized to the point where one can evolve long enough to deprive itself of the collective heard.\r\n\n\n\nIt is impossible to understand conscious singularity, because as social primates, we will always depend on other animals of the same species in order to survive.  This is why I feel salvia is inaccessible in the current human state.  Were not quite ready to leave any and all reference or attachment to the collective consciousness which binds all of us together.  We are essentially a Borg mind, 100th Monkey effect in full force and always have been to further the evolution of our species.  Our planet is within it\u0092s current state of disarray, chaos, and schizogenesis due to the collective state humanity has created.  The DMT is the embodiment of collective consciousness.  It destroys my ego so that I can see the destruction my ego has caused upon myself and others.  \r\n\n\n\nIt is built in hardware within the human pineal gland, tissue, and blood.  Designed for what I feel is to destroy ego and connect us in a state of being where we are not influenced by crude emotional states, cultural biases, and petty selfish gains.  This is why I believe the drug is so sterile and neutral in nature.  It doesn\u0092t sugar coat things with an amphetamine high like the phethylamine mescaline.  Nor does it dilute and denigrate the nervous system as does the debilitating effects of alcohol.  In the end this stuff is a conduit into \u0093God consciousness.\u0094  The irony being that state has always been here, always was here, always will be here.  We are simply too preoccupied with our miniscule and trivial pursuits to acknowledge it.  We are the ones we were waiting for!!!\r\n\n\n\nI\u0092m using Salvia as a reference material because it is far more prevalent and accessible in it\u0092s current legal state then DMT.  More readers then not have probably encountered Salvia but not DMT, therefore, I felt a description of it\u0092s similarity to DMT may familiarize one with what they may possibly expect from DMT in terms of magnitude, duration, and intensity.\r\n\n\n\nAt this point I should discuss the breakthrough experience I had.  I have no recollection of the day or time of this event.  Those facts feel irrelevant to what I encountered during that brief 10 minute period.  I wish I could accurately provide a date and time in order to sequentially document this event more accurately.  For myself, the experience is so profound and overwhelming that it is impossible for me to collect my thoughts into a cohesive state shortly after the event had subsided.  I need months to process the experience and gather innate data which the DMT is feeding my body.  I can feel minimal amounts of DMT activating throughout my body at this moment.  The memory of the intense experience lingers.  It never leaves the back of my mind.  It doesn\u0092t feel proper to attempt to define the most profound experience of my life within hours of when it happened.  From a scientific standpoint this is the most relevant approach to documenting the effects of DMT.  From a physiological and psychological standpoint it\u0092s very premature and the experience is shortchanged by the immediate effects vs. the longer standing repercussions.\r\n\n\n\nI feel as though I am denying myself and others the full magnitude of the DMT experience by pigeon holing it down to a time and place.  This feels irrelevant in the greater scheme of the chemical and its role within the human body.  It is always with me and always will be with me.  What I chronicle is merely a peak release of this compound which I have coordinated in order for it to direct me to a state of consciousness I need at that time and space.  \r\n\n\n\nI don\u0092t smoke DMT on a whim, it tells my body and my brain when I \u0093need\u0094 to smoke it.  I don\u0092t feel as though I control when, how, or why I need to smoke an incredibly powerful, disturbing, and outright shattering experience.  In fact most of my very neutral DMT experiences are bordering on unpleasant.  The realm I am taken to is so outside of the jurisdiction and imagination of my conscious brain it is down right terrifying yet complete nirvana at the same simultaneous moment.  Such a foreign place is not dared treaded upon without a degree of psychological preparation.  This is why Salvia is usually a \u0093one hit wonder\u0094 for most people.  They cannot fathom the place, assimilate it, and interpret it with their current conscious state without deep preparation and forewarning.  Going from \u0093here\u0094 to \u0093there\u0094 in 20 seconds is too much for most people and they will instinctively resist rather then embrace and let themselves go into this experience.\r\n\n\n\nSo onto the trip or whatever one wants to call it.  It was no trip, I hate that term yet it is so accessible and immediately identifiable I need to use it to create a reference point.  It was a journey.  A trip is short and ends abruptly in the schism of the relevance of time.  A trip could be 1 hour or 20 hours.  Every other psychedelic experience I\u0092ve used is a \u0093trip,\u0094 because of these traits.  DMT is not a trip but a journey.  It lasts less then any other entheogen I\u0092ve ever encountered but takes me to a place through a cosmic forest of thoughts and ideas over the longest duration I can fathom.  I go to a timeless place without any reference to any time or physical sensation.  I don\u0092t exist, I am merely consciousness expressing itself in the most primal state identifiable by the brain\u0092s ability to detect it.\r\n\n\n\nWhat I recall is the recollection of a meaningless night, time and place.  It is to the best of my memory and ability the account of the DMT experience I had that night.  The settings were familiar and felt completely reassuring within my surroundings.  There was no sense of fear or hesitation within this \u0093chemical being\u0094 for which I was about to envelope.  I loaded around 60-80 milligrams of the yellowish DMT extract which was partially obtained using Xylene.  I\u0092ve heard this substance extracts a form of DMT which is very negative in nature.  I don\u0092t feel that sense.  It has more to do with the situation, setting, and expectations then the actual chemical makeup which is simply a byproduct of the experience itself as a precursor which is only realized after the entire experience has occurred.\r\n\n\n\nAfter the substance was loaded into the glass pipe, I took a blow torch and held it roughly two inches away from the glass pipe.  I lit the flame then slowly let the spiraling smoke swirl around within the glass pipe.  I used my index finger to close off the top chamber hole to allow the smoke to concentrate.  After around 30 seconds I began to slowly inhale the substance into my lungs.  During this entire time the lighter was continually burning and the substance was continually vaporizing into smoke.  Within one long 30 second hit I managed to consume the entire amount of DMT.  It was held in my lungs for another 30 seconds or so before I exhaled.  Before I let the chemical out of my lungs I began to feel the effects.  An immediate sense of disorientation clouded my conscious state.  I was instantly inundated with thoughts of panic and anxiety.  This feeling seemed to be a natural response to the profound changes which were rapidly organizing within my peripheral view.  \r\n\n\n\nBefore I could think another thought my brain was blasted with intense clarity.  Rich reds and warm spectrum colors exploded into my view.  I saw all matter as nothing more then an atomic \u0093reddish\u0094 field of wild vibration which was pulsing within everything that my eyes could absorb.  Reality was a vibrating pulsation of \u0093bead type atoms\u0094 almost like the static on a channel-less television screen.  I saw everything for what it truly was.  Everything in mater became nothing more then a pulsing vibrating collection of trillions of circles making up this reality.  Reality became an illusion as though my body felt distanced from any reference to it.  Reality was just a pulse within the cosmic vibration of the infinite cosmic consciousness.  I was that cosmic consciousness and it began to dissolve my physical body and ego simultaneously.  I felt the disillusion from my body was necessary to provide my consciousness with the capacity to enter hyper dimensional space.\r\n\n\n\nI was beginning to loose the ability to control my arms and legs.  They felt like silly putty as they squirmed around like an octopus recoiling while trying to reassure itself that it still possessed the instinctual ability to move.  An immediate detachment of my body was stirring within my mind.  It wanted to keep itself aligned with anything with which it could recognize, but it could not.  I wanted to stay in the locality within my physical body.  When I say \u0093I\u0094 what I mean is the consciousness that expresses itself within my body.  Leaving this \u0093hive\u0094 consciousness which my brain had been so accustomed to, was frightening.  At this point \u0093I\u0094 was catapulted out of this reality and dimensional plane.  There was a simultaneous blackout which probably lasted more then a split second in real time.  It felt as though it had occurred over several minutes.  The events above happened over what I would guess were 30 seconds to 1 minute.\r\n\n\n\nImmediately \u0093I\u0094 was now in a new hive mind which felt more real then anything I\u0091ve ever felt in this reality.  My vocabulary and articulation are obviously severely lacking to accurately describe the next transpiring of events.  I cannot verbalize it using any vocabulary known.  No word can provide or define what I went through.  I will say it was the most \u0091REAL\u0092 experience I\u0092ve ever had in my entire 27 years of conscious thought.  The reason being, none of it was verbal.  Everything was visual, all communication visual, all thought visual.  Everything was visual as it felt to be the most efficient and least misinterpreted means of experience and communication in this place.\r\n\n\n\nI now know why millions of people have extraterrestrial abductions.  I know for a fact many of these people are having these abductions.  The thing is their body never leaves this reality in order to have those experiences.  Their consciousness is being absorbed by extradimensional beings.  I\u0092m not talking Terence Mckenna style \u0091jeweled elves\u0092 bumping around squeamishly.  The beings that I contacted were far more Earnest, sterile, and objective.  To such a degree, they are the embodiment of science in it\u0092s physical manifestation of laws, discourse, control, and theoretical ideology.  I was a lab rat on a silver luminous table observed by these completely neutral beings.  Basically I had been transported from my physical 3rd dimensional body and simultaneously placed into a bizarre 4th dimensional headspace.  \r\n\n\n\nI had no body in this realm.  I was an etheric being lying down on a table.  My body was translucent as if a form of penetrating light through the skin displaying every skeletal structure, blood vessel and cell within my body.  This was all light, illuminating itself and manifesting into what my detached brain must have generated as a holographic human body.  My brain was still there, it was simply connected to another place through the DMT molecule.  This connection of an unidentifiable, alien state, is the source for such confusion which my brain could not clarify into anything remotely recognizable.\r\n\n\n\nI specifically remember these 3 beings as though I was looking at them before this computer screen.  It is as if they are a part of me, a part I don\u0092t understand or can connect with because they occupy a place I cannot normally feel, see, or detect.  I felt so trapped at this point.  \u0093How on earth are these beings here around me and everyone else and nobody has any sense of their presence?\u0094  What I\u0092m guessing is these beings are operating on a different frequency then our own.  We\u0092ve got hundreds of radio stations penetrating the sky, but only hear one station at a time.  DMT is like an antenna which attracts other dimensions and draws them to this one.  Thus allowing the individual to access and \u0093tune in\u0094 to these frequencies which were otherwise scrambled and not able to be processed by the brain.\r\n\n\n\nThese beings spoke to me telepathically.  When I state telepathic I mean whatever they wanted me to know they \u0093gave it to me.\u0094  It wasn\u0092t like a beam or thought within the mind.  I simply knew what they wanted me to know without seeing or thinking anything.  It was an emotional state in which I could feel what they wanted to tell me.  Through their instant transmission, I knew exactly what they wanted and required of me.  It was so much more efficient and straightforward then verbal communication.  Feeling evoked immediate internal communication and knowledge.  I simultaneously knew what, who, and why they and I were there.  They directed \u0093thoughts through feelings\u0094 into my mind which I immediately recognized.  This didn\u0092t require any philosophical or intellectual decoding or interpretation.  I simply knew exactly what they were thinking because they could somehow transfer their intentions through imagery which I couldn\u0092t see but directly felt.\r\n\n\n\nI remember exactly to the very finest detail what these beings looked like in physicality.  The environment itself felt like something straight out of Ridley Scott\u0092s \u0091alien.\u0092  There was a bizarre static type environment with predominate browns, blacks, and grays.  It felt very organic with interconnecting insectoid coils and wormlike tubing networks lining the walls and background.  It seemed to be a ship or interstellar vessel.  I was in a circular room which was occupied by three beings which were standing in front of me.   They were overlooking my etheric body which was laid upright onto a silver elongated slab.  These entities were very skinny.  Their body I recall vaguely because I was too preoccupied with their face.  It was blackish is if they were all wearing a black jumpsuit or covering.\r\n\n\n\nThe face was the most disturbing aspect.  All three had grey metallic faces.  These were nothing like the Zeta-Reticluan Alien grays with large black almond eyes many people describe.  Although I could see how the two entities could be mistaken by a person in such a frightened state.  Their face was smooth, grey, and metallic.  They had no eyes, ears, or mouth.  The face was one complete solid vessel.  I felt as though it was a mask of some type.  It was as if they were using a certain costume and mask in which I could identify, while denying their true nature from my vision.  Their metallic mask had subtle features imprinted within it.  There were what appeared residual elements of a stubby nose, the inlay of what was once eyes, and small slits which resembled babies lips.  I felt as though these beings had evolved so drastically they no longer had need for the five senses.  They no longer needed eyes, ears, lips, etc to express themselves.  They were expression personified in my own thought of what I visualized they were physically.\r\n\n\n\nEverything they did or said was by vibration and emotion in the only way I could seem to understand it.  They were the grays as many people have described.  But they were not aliens, and they were not insectoid.  These elements were simply infused into the environment which gave the impression that these beings possessed those traits.  These beings \u0093were me\u0094 in a different space and a different dimension.  The alien nature of the circumstances initially prevented me from realizing this.  I felt as though I was from one radio station and they from another.  The DMT, therefore, must be the antenna connecting different aspects of the same consciousness.  These stations can communicate by crossing paths and sharing data from different dimensional frequencies.  This may sound delusional, but this reality we live within is the true delusion.  \r\n\n\n\nThe matrix is real, but our bodies are being used as a vessel to experience 3rd dimensional space.  This 3rd dimensional information is then \u0092uploaded\u0092 by other dimensional beings who cannot experience this one.  I only know this because the DMT told me and quite blatantly showed me how this process works.  Before my trips with DMT, I would have thought this information was coming from a psychotic schizophrenic.  I now know better.  I remember what they had constantly expressed almost a dozen times over the course of the \u0093consolidation\u0094 process.  I say consolidation because these beings \u0093WERE ME\u0094 in another dimension.  They cared not for how I got there or why I was there.  They simply knew I was coming and anticipated my arrival.  It is as if they were a more advanced part of myself which I was completely ignorant of knowing.  \r\n\n\n\nI was them and they were me.  I was like the reptilian brain that they were studying from the distant recesses of there own.  They were like the more evolved Neo-Cortex attempting to understand the lizard brain.  I believe this alternative realm feels very reptilian and insectoid in nature.  It feels this way because we are accessing a dimension which displays the information these beings wish to \u0093take\u0094 from us.  They appear this way, look this way, and behave in this way.  They need to acquire this reptilian form, in order to access the information they take from our psyche.  They are visible as a mirror reflection of what they are seeking.  Just as I am accessing a mirror reflection of the higher dimensional state which I am seeking.\r\n\n\n\nThis knowledge Transphere feels like the way in which they can \u0093de-evolve\u0094 to become like me and I can \u0093evolve\u0094 to become like them.  It is as if 'They' and 'I' are both assimilating and experiencing a distant past and future of ourselves, simultaneously, in order to better integrate the two.  \u0093They\u0094 and \u0093I\u0094 both wanted to have a mutual exchange.  I felt as though the trauma I experienced was far less severe then what they had.  I believe this is why so many people have negative extraterrestrial experiences.  They feel as though these beings are taking \u0093something\u0094 from them and not returning it.  I believe this is true to an extent.  When I was sitting in that chair these beings \u0093downloaded me.\u0094  \r\n\n\n\nThe matrix is completely real, only much more etheric and less mechanized then Hollywood would have you believe.  These three beings downloaded me, took my consciousness, and Xeroxed it, storing it into an essence with which I felt they could somehow benefit from this information in the future.  They copied my life memories, experiences, and dreams.  Then stored this information in order to 'get high' from it and experience it much like I utilize DMT to get high.  It is so bizarre yet true.  My memories are a portal gateway from which DMT transmits them to these beings.  They then utilize these fragments into knowledge in order to get high by assimilating the information the DMT is feeding them.  This is the same process occuring within me as their knowledge infuses itself into me.  Getting me high with the same data transmitted in a different dimension and state.  To put it quite blatently it is a spiritual mind orgy of energy.\r\n\n\n\nThe perceived negativity I felt, lies within the fact, that I knew they took more from me then they gave to me.  When I was downloaded I squirmed in my chair.  I could feel an invisible force penetrate my body and my mind.  This force \u0093pulled\u0094 my essence into a place which appeared \u0093higher\u0094 and less \u0093dense\u0094 then my own.  They beamed me, probed me, and copied me, and yet I never left the chair.  These events all occured from an invisible force.  There was no 'beam me up scotty' computer generated particles.  It was all simultaneous without any visual sense of it's presence.  This experience was rapid because it was happening on the tail end of the peak of the experience.  \r\n\n\n\nThese beings knew they did not have much time and I felt an urgency within their discourse.  At the point I was squirming, I felt my body again.  The peak was weaning after the 5 minute mark.  I then rapidly descended back into my body as my consciousness began to \u0093fill out\u0094 the various portions of it.  I first felt my brain and it\u0092s awareness of the current surroundings.  This awareness then spread down into the center of my body and proceeded toward my arms then legs.  I rapidly felt a decent back into current consciousness.  There was no tunnel or white light or anything of that nature.  I was just simultaneously brought back to this dimensional state in the same simultaneous manner I had left it. \r\n\n\n\nIntense distortions of space and time were present.  No true hallucinations after this point were experienced.  In fact, the only true hallucinations I\u0092ve ever had are under the effects of DMT.  I\u0092ve heard Atropine or Datura based alkaloids can cause this, but this seems most accurately a \u0091delirium state\u0092 and not a true \u0091alternate dimensional plane.\u0092  After about five to ten minutes of experiencing what I would describe as a peak 1,000 microgram acid type 100 milligram psilocybin combo trip, I was back to complete baseline. \r\n\n\n\nI could describe the effects outside of the peak but they feel like any other tryptamine based hallucinogen in high doses.  My interest is in the extra-dimensional states with which the consciousness seems to direct itself.  If I were to look at myself from the DMT hyperdimensioanal state I would be very disturbed.  The trauma of entering the DMT plane is far less excruciating then leaving it.  This is probably why many people who experience a sublime heaven-like near death state don\u0092t want to come back.  Because after experiencing the most brilliant aspects of DMT hyperspace this 3rd dimensional reality seems very primitive, traumatizing, and incredibly unnerving, given the atrocities the psyche knows exist within it.  \r\n\n\n\nI feel like DMT is the reason I have sought out alternate dimensions.  I find this current reality to be a very schizophrenic reality.  In this place everything is chaotic, wrong, and wicked. Where the most corrupt and narcissistic individuals make the most money, rule the most territory, and control the greatest Spiritual knowledge.  Where religious and shamanic priests herd their subjects in perpetually mundane and \u0092spiritually-fetal\u0092 existence.  Where finance governs the social interest of the masses while disregarding ethical integrity in the name of personal profiteering. \r\n\n\n\nI hate this place because I know that once I\u0092m coming down from DMT I\u0092m back within my own selfish, corrupt, and decadent actions.  The DMT shows me my deficiencies in a blatantly neutral and simple fashion.  Much like its incredibly simple chemical compilation within the human mind.  It tells me that I am part of what has created the very fabric of reality within which I occupy.  Instinctually I know this, but the DMT shows me this through providing me with nirvana and then letting me materialize back into 'this awefull place.'  \r\n\n\n\nWhen I\u0092m back here I become part of the collective consciousness that is the human race.  I look at the very state of this reality I have helped generate.  The very place I occupy I have collectively created with my fellow humans.  And for this, I am deeply disappointed with myself and others.  We have so much potential which has been circumvented by selfish interest.  Humanity simply doesn't care about spirituality anymore.  It doesn't want to have these experiences.  It only wants what instantly impacts it for it's own physical gain.  What this shows me is a warning to the Homo Sapien species.  This entity must learn to re-connect itself with the organic or it is doomed to self-destruction through artificially integrated expression.  This artificial expression is the next step in evolution physically.  What we will loose in the process is the very nature of our organic 'soul.'  It will be lost among implants, cybernetic grafts, and RFID integration.  This will all happen because of the ego and it's persistance to revel in it's own brilliance.\r\n\n\n\nMy ultimate theory is that DMT is a \u0093transport molecule\u0094 which periodically impacts a few individuals experiencing it\u0092s profound revelations.  Through it I see who and what I really am.  It gives me all the means by which to understand my higher spiritual self.  It is integral to my being, because it governs the very nature of my brain\u0092s impulses on a minute\u0092 vibration.  Humanity must realize the reality it occupies is nothing more then a conglomeration of individual consciousness expressing itself on a subjective basis. This is the beauty of DMT.  What it has told me is that we are all one.  It displays itself in plants, animals, and fungi to demonstrate it is all pervasive and all encompassing.  This substance is the binding force which links all elements of this reality together.  It shows me I am not the ultimate egocentric being I think I am.  I am just a piece of a greater cosmic brain.  I am a thought within the singularity that is God.  DMT is my ethereal connection to God through a simplistic chemical transportation outlet.  \r\n\n\n\nTo summarize, DMT is a portal into God consciousness.  An \u0091etheric highway grid\u0092 were conscious thought, ideas, and wisdom freely traverses in order to better evolve the all pervasive essence which is everything.  This is the most simplistic and accurate depiction I have ever conceived when trying to attempt to understand who, what, and where I am.\r\n\n\n\nThis experience was so profound I remember it cosmos-second by cosmos-second like the instant I was born.  The next closest memory I have is my first sexual encounter at 17 years old, which is fuzzy and only contains minute by minute bits and pieces.  That is the effect this experience had on me.\r\n\n\n\nI just started reading Rick Strauss man\u0092s \u0093DMT: The Spirit Molecule.\u0094  It is profound that western science is starting to discover what I feel DMT has been telling me and guiding me toward since conception all along.  This shows how the Patrilineal religions, which have destroyed and dominated western beliefs and conscious expansion, are beginning to disintegrate.  I have to disagree with Rich Straussman in regards to referencing DMT as a Spirit Molecule.  From my experience it is not a spirit molecule.  DMT is the \u0093Transport Molecule.\u0094  The spirit is and always was there because it is all things in all dimensions simultaneously.  DMT allows the subjective elements of spirit to enter physical form at roughly 49 days after conception.  You and I are those subjective elements of the \u0091omnipresence\u0092 which is all things. We come here to experience.  At the moment of death DMT allows for our part of spirit to leave this dimension and reintegrate with the collective whole.  All of the memory, thoughts, and life we lived are brought with the spirit as it adds to the \u0091God Consciousness.\u0092 This is evolution.  Not on a physical scale, but on an etheric spiritual scale.\r\n\n\n\nThis report is a tribute to what my most startling DMT trip created within my mind.  It shook me so hard and swayed me so much, I know that DMT is \u0093the doorway to God.\u0094 I theorize this is why so much of organized religion believes God is with us, around us, envelopes us, and will always be.  This is DMT, a portal or bridge way from God to God, \u0093they\u0094 to \u0093you\u0094 and \u0093I.\u0094  We are all the subjective thoughts of the God singularity which pervades all matter, DMT has shown me this.  Its simply God hasn\u0092t quite figured out how to integrate its subjective thoughts in order to link all of the various dimensions it occupies.  DMT is a tool to help connect these places.  This makes it what I refer to as a \u0093transport molecule.\u0094  Found within us, outside of us, and beyond us. \r\n\n\n\nI now know this reality is but a dream of the divine being from which my thoughts are registering in physical space.  All of this is a complete and utter illusion.  We collectively create this illusion and we create the very reality of the illusion within which we live.  If I were to summarize everything I explained in this report it would come down to this one sentence\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085..\r\n\n\n\nYOU ARE THE ONE YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!\r\n\n\n\nYou are everything that is and always will make possible."

        "report_text": "This report documents my experiences with the combination of smoked DMT and 5-MeO-DMT. I am male, at the time of the experiences I was 23 years old, weighing 125 pounds. I am well versed in botanical, fungal, and chemical entheogens. Before these experiences I had become familiar with both DMT and 5-MeO-DMT at doses ranging from light, to being annihilated by white light. My experiences with these tryptamines had been variously beautiful, terrifying, subtle, and overwhelming. Taken separately I find that DMT tended towards the beautiful and 5-MeO-DMT towards the uncomfortable. Both together, is something else again.\r\n\n\n\nOver a four week period I experimented several times with a combination of the two substances, searching to know myself deeper and gain personal insights. As if either DMT or 5-MeO-DMT aren\u0092t intense enough on their own, smoking the two together is a one-two knock-out. This is as far out as I have journeyed, using any substance or technique. It is truly beyond the beyond. I will present my original notes, edited for clarity and with any added commentary within square brackets.\r\n\n\n\nSession 1: March 22, 2008 midday\r\n\nMountain consciousness\r\n\n\n\nSubstance and dosage: One large inhalation from a glass vaporization tube of a mixture of roughly equal parts DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.\r\n\n\n\nSet and setting: Hiking with Gemini in the mountains on a sunny early spring day. We had wandered off the trail following the edge of this small lake, drawn towards a sunny ridge. We weren\u0092t disappointed, discovering a small round bowl of land on the other side of the ridge. It would have been swampy in the bottom in summer, but right now it was filled with snow and the tracks of deer, elk, and coyotes. Scrubby willows and aspen rise from the low areas, and a pine forest rings us, with the snowy mountain peaks towering overhead. I find a sunny sheltered spot, a piece of dry hillside under a cluster of three pine trees. Grass, bearberry, and fallen needles cover a comfortable area for sitting down.\r\n\n\n\nIt was a touch breezy for a normal lighter but conveniently Gemini had brought his jet lighter with him. Once I had found the appropriate method and distance at which to hold the lighter, it vaporized my chemical concoction quite nicely. I took a full lungful of white vapours. As soon as I had finished inhaling, Gemini put on a song on his phone which actually has extraordinarly good sound considering its just a phone. The song was \u0093Hold Tight London\u0094 by The Chemical Brothers. Perfect musical accompaniment for the moment.\r\n\n\n\nThe tryptamine flash hit me strong and hard and beautiful. I breathed deeply, feeling the energy and letting it flow through me smoothly and unimpeded. I felt a union with the forest and the mountains around me. The forest I could feel as one large consciousness, and the mountains overlooking as stern protectors. It was a very peaceful feeling, more pleasant than diving in an inside, artificial environment. It is hard to be overwhelmed in nature, or I can be overwhelmed but its comfortable. Trees and grass and sunshine.\r\n\n\n\nI began to drop out of the initial flash, but this combination is a tricky one. When I think I\u0092m starting to come down, that is when the 5-MeO really gets to me. I find the reintegration period on 5-MeO-DMT is usually difficult, as the psychedelic effects continue for longer than DMT does. 5-MeO-DMT has such a high energy, high vibration that it is easy for me to feel overloaded. If I begin to clamp down on that energy vibration, or try to reintegrate and think normally too soon, then the excess energy gets transferred into bodily discomfort. Nausea, slight dizzyness, sometimes an anxious feeling. This time, in the natural setting I faired well with the residual effects. I stayed in a meditative state much of the time and grounded the energy.\r\n\n\n\nI was staring up at the mountain overlooking us. It felt like I was talking to the mountain without words, both of us becoming aware of the other. As this happened, a cool and playful wind came whipping down on us. It seemed to me that the wind was coming right down off the mountain tops, bringing with it the scent of ice and snow. The mountain was talking back, telling me its own story of lofty heights, jagged rock, and sparkling wind-packed snowdrifts.\r\n\n\n\nWe lazed around for quite a lot longer in the sun as I slowly pieced myself back together. Gemini smoked a couple bowls of hash. After staring in amazement at the way everything glowed in the vibrant sunshine, I finally accepted a toke or two of hash myself. I was left with a nice afterglow from the 5-MeO/DMT mixture, my mood was very positive and I was enjoying being out in the sun and nature so much. As usual I felt hungry after coming down, raiding the bag of pistachios we\u0092d brought along. Afterwards we continued our hike round the lake, then eventually made our way to the nearest mountain town for an satisfying feast of burgers (not the fast food kind!) and beer.\r\n\n\n\nSession 2: April 1, 2008 evening\r\n\n\n\nRoughly equal parts DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, one hit is definitely enough. Setting: My room, comfortable environment with dim light, music and a pillow at my back for support. Mindset: Curious to try this combination again.\r\n\n\n\nImmediate impression: There are no words for this combination! I've learned that it is best for me to try not to come out of the trance state too soon. When the initial DMT flash begins to fade is when the 5-Methoxy grabs me by the balls. That\u0092s when I got the fear, focussing everything on letting the energy flow through me into the ground. Grounding.\r\n\n\n\nI purged again [as I had recently done after smoking just DMT] when I came down. I reintegrated too soon and it overloaded me with energy. The space of clarity I had gotten into was too much to try to put back in the old box. DMT is the light and 5-MeO the power.\r\n\n\n\n[\u0085 after a little more integration time:]\r\n\n\n\nI think I blasted off at 7:23 and it\u0092s now 7:58. Apparently after giving myself a little time for integration, there are words for the experience after all. The combination lasts a lot longer than DMT does. It was that second wave, the 5-MeO, that really got me.\r\n\n\n\nFor music I was playing \u0093Oleander\u0094 by Bluetech, though honestly I wasn\u0092t at all aware of the music as the internal state was too involving. Soothing background sound anyway, a hypnotic and beautiful piece of ambient dub. \r\n\n\n\nAt first it was the typical tryptamine flash. Fractalizing and folding up. The addition of the 5-MeO adds a blinding white light to the scene, and any thought of not \u0093breaking through\u0094 is washed away by the intensity. I was simply annihilated. \r\n\n\n\nAs I began to come out of the flash, I started thinking too much. Thinking about my setting, in my parents house. I am no longer comfortable letting go completely here. Maybe I never have been. This is extremely important, I have to be able to let go fully to engage the trance state in a positive manner.\r\n\n\n\nAt moments I was getting it. Just tapped in to that immense energy, I held my hands over the ground letting it all flow through me and into the earth. I reached a space of absolute clarity. I could feel distinctly what was holding me back and what I needed to do to move past what was holding me back.\r\n\n\n\nAs I came down I was flipping in and out of the \u0093tapped in\u0094 lightning rod feeling. Each time I lost the calm trance I became anxious and would have all these worries run through my head. I need to get out of this house, was an overwhelming feeling. Things will be better when I move out. I felt an intense empathy and gratefulness for a friend of mine, thinking that she would be able to weather this kind of intensity just fine. I wanted to call her, talk with her when I came down from the tryptamine flash.\r\n\n\n\nThere was a definate breaking point to the energy. I coughed. This was a sign of my body fighting back, reintegrating. It was too much. That coughing purging again, just like the last couple times. It\u0092s partially a cleansing, partially me just being overwhelmed by the residual 5-Methoxy energy tremor.\r\n\n\n\nSession 3: April 2, 2008 midday\r\n\nThat smell tells you\r\n\n\n\nSame setting, same mixture of roughly equal portions DMT and 5-MeO-DMT as last time. No clear intention, it just felt right. Pursuant to yesterday\u0092s experience I guess.\r\n\n\n\nFor music I played \u0093Lost and Found\u0094 (just the last 3-4 minutes) by The Orb, followed by Oleander by Bluetech (I wanted to use this song again to keep the setting consistent), followed finally by \u0093Let the Music set you Free\u0094 by The Orb. I had been consuming lots of a kratom and yerba mate tea before the experience, which possibly had some influence [my experiences lead me to hypothesize that kratom particularly can increase my receptiveness to smoked tryptamines]. Initially the (low) dose of DMT left me in contact with my body and breathing freely, but as the 5-MeO seeped in that sensation of my body became more and more distant.\r\n\n\n\nThe first three to four minutes I was indeed, Lost, and did not Find myself until the song changed. During this phase I had sensations of pressure all over my body, but particularly in the stomach/solar plexus region. The key to not being overwhelmed is to feel. Don\u0092t shy away from or resist the unpleasant tension in my stomach, feel it. As I feel it, the nature changes and it becomes manageable. Just intense energization. Eyes are closed.\r\n\n\n\nI was aware of the song change, entering a new phase in which I spent a lot of time breathing heavily as the waves came over me. I kept being directed into certain body positions as I sat cross legged. One was to let my head drop precipitiously forward, and then bouncing up and down slightly like a spring. This seemed to form a \u0093wave\u0094 that put me in communication with something. The waving motion of my head was important. When coming out of the \u0093wave\u0094 I would have to lean my head all the way back, and my breathing would become heavy as the intensity of effects would shoot up a notch. \r\n\n\n\nAnytime I moved my head it would create a wave of dizzyness. Moving my body more was out of the question, as this would have led to nausea due to the extreme dizzyness. The dizzyness was part of the trip though, somehow. I made some strange repetitive humming noises that seemed necessary at the time. The effects during this period were very similar to, say, a quarter oz of strong fungus. I kept trancing out with the waves, and with eyes now open crawling visuals were everywhere.\r\n\n\n\nTen or eleven minutes had elasped since blastoff as the song changed again. This was around when I became integrated with my body. A third phase, coming down. I would like to comment on duration of the experience: If I smoke just DMT, I get a 2-3 minute \u0093flash\u0094 and come out of the trance state after 5-7 minutes. When I smoke the combination of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, I stay in the flash for 3-4 minutes and come out of the trance after 10-11 minutes. So for me adding the 5-MeO-DMT lengthens the effects and increases the potency. I hypothesize that the effects of this mixture are simply additive, not truly synergistic [eg in the case of the harmala alkaloids]. Adding 15 mg of 5-MeO-DMT to 15 of DMT is quite strong simply because of the higher potency of the 5-MeO-DMT.\r\n\n\n\nWithin fifteen minutes of blastoff, I was down enough to move around without getting dizzy and to start writing this report. Song lyrics seem appropriate: \u0093That smell tells you\u0085\u0094 Yes, yes it does. That burnt tryptamine smell, so distinctive. \u0093If the music sets you free, then let it be! Love is the answer, only love can conquer\u0085\u0094\r\n\n\n\nSession 4: April 2, 2008 evening\r\n\n\n\nSubstance, setting, and music: Same as last time. Mindset: Emotionally distraught. Struggling with my feelings of love for this girl, Jess. Recently home from having seen her, and having the issue been brought up again. It is difficult for me, feeling love for a woman who is marrying another man.\r\n\n\n\nIntention: Looking for guidance, resolution, insight, or even just forgetfulness and sleep. I had a fatalistic attitude, feeling so upset inside that for once I had no fear going into the experience. Whatever happened, it couldn\u0092t possibly be more uncomfortable than what I was feeling already could it? I was not scared, because I did not really care what happened to me.\r\n\n\n\nIt took three inhalations,  not one, to get a suitable \u0093flash\u0094 this time. Perhaps I was more psychically resistant in this mindset, or perhaps I had simply loaded less material in the pipe and did not get that critical mass of vaporization to blast off. This time I had a tension in my stomach going into the experience, and as the vapours took effect this tension eased somewhat, the reverse of usual.\r\n\n\n\nI asked for insight and guidance, and it came. Transferance feelings and an echo effect: Why is this feeling I have for Jess so strong, and so crushing? The last time I felt this way about a girl was my ex, with whom I had an intense on and off again three year relationship. Having that feeling of love again, I felt excitement, and simultaneously, fear. The fear goes deep. I don\u0092t want the same situation to play out again. I don\u0092t want to feel abandonned and separated again. I was transfering some of my feelings and emotions regarding how my relationship with my ex worked out onto my relationship with Jess. Similarities in the situations have me subconsciously generalizing and expecting the same outcome even though Jess is a different person. But it goes deeper than this\u0085\r\n\n\n\nPart of a larger pattern and facing the core: I have placed myself again in a situation of externalizing my happiness. I have programmed myself so that when I am around Jess, I feel happy when she interacts positively with me. When she smiles at me, our eyes meet, a hug or a touch, it fills me with joy and tingles of excitement. When she seems distant or I see her passion for her fiancee, it makes me feel crushed inside. I feel the joy drained out of me and I become anxious, listless and with butterflies in my stomach precluding eating. The change I have to make is the same I made once before: I have to come from a stable basis of loving myself in order to form a positive long-term relationship with Jess. I have to let go of the desire for reciprocity.\r\n\n\n\nThe situation with Jess is part of a much larger picture. I caught a few glimpses of it. The pieces are shifting, the situation is changing. I felt I was being brought face-to-face with the core of myself, deep into the primitive and fundamental feelings and emotions driving me to think, feel and act as I do. I am experiencing this feeling now with Jess so that I can work through it. I will be stronger for this experience, and will have gained a better understanding of love.\r\n\n\n\nThree dimensional, translinguistic, meaning-containing and feeling-oriented, self-transforming structures of light and colour. I think I finally get part of what Terence McKenna was on about. I could see everything, my \u0093situation\u0094 as this rotating, shifting object. Black surfaces edged in colours spinning round a glowing white core. The object was a visual representation of what I was thinking and feeling and how the situation was changing. It contained information and expressed it in a manner beyond words.\r\n\n\n\nBody positioning and letting go: As I came out of the flash I felt grief and sadness as a pure and raw emotion. For a few moments I let the feeling fill me completely. I didn\u0092t resist, whatever was most uncomfortable and unpleasant was what I had to open up to and feel the most intensly. It obviously wasn\u0092t a good feeling, but I felt strangely dissociated from the feeling, and a calm core was aware that things weren\u0092t so bad really.\r\n\n\n\nI was directed by the drugs and how I was feeling into lying sideways in a fetal position on the ground. The grief pouring through me was intensifying but I found myself slipping away. Let go, let go, let go. I did finally let go. The sadness and anxiety faded as my ego slipped away. Merging with the ambient environment, and now bathed in calmness and light.\r\n\n\n\nI came out of this brief ego-loss, twitching and shivering. I was cold, lying here on the floor coming down. A huge wave of tiredness washed over me. I decided I should go straight to bed, and got up still dizzy, unsteady and disoriented. I kept telling myself not to loose the trance state, but by the time I undressed and got into bed and set the alarm for the next day and turned out the light, I had lost the trance. I couldn\u0092t get back to that place of ego-loss, it was too late. I had integrated. I got to sleep relatively easily which was a blessing, and was somewhat calmer in the morning though we will see how I feel the next time I\u0092m around Jess.\r\n\n\n\nI need to reconnect with that calm center within me, that center radiating peace and love and joy simply for the fact of existence. I am feeling drawn towards cactus for trying to reconnect this way and may pursue that path in the near future.\r\n\n\n\nSession 5: April 3, 2008 evening\r\n\nWomb of the Mother\r\n\n\n\nSame setting, same substance, and similar music as last time. Mindset: Reasonably calm, reflective but not upset as I had been the day before. Intention: Simply seeing where I might go.\r\n\n\n\nI loaded the last of the mixture into the tube, though there was plenty of resin still in there too. I took two large inhalations, strangely not choking on or feeling the vapours much this time. After one breath I set the pipe down but didn\u0092t feel it would take me all the way, so I went back for another.\r\n\n\n\nThere are three distinct phases to the experience, this has been consistent through all my experiences with the mixture but became clear to me only on this trip. The first phase is the tryptamine \u0093flash\u0094. It is during this phase that I lost contact with my body the first time, and also despite having music playing I am not really consciously aware of it. The first song was \u0093Once Upon the Sea of Blissful Awareness\u0094 by Shpongle, just about seven minutes long. I blasted off one minute into the song, and by the last couple minutes was consciously aware of the music again. \u0093My mind craves nectar day and night.\u0094 This phase of the experience is all-involving and irrestistably intense.\r\n\n\n\nAfter the first phase is a false comedown, a brief lull. The tryptamine flash fades but a second, almost more powerful sensation takes over. There are sensations of pressure and I become aware of my heart pumping. The energy intensifies, heavy and thick threatening to overwhelm me. I have to concentrate everything on breathing and letting the energy flow through me into the earth. Grounding and feeling secure, comfortable. Reminding myself to just flow and ride the feeling. It is this second wave that can bring the fear with it. Existential fear, a threat to my ego. During this phase information and insight bombards me.\r\n\n\n\nAs the second wave fades, it leaves me in phase three, tryptamine activation. The effects are similar to a really strong dose of mushrooms or LSD, when you are completely involved in the internal experience. I am often directed into particular body positions that seem to amplify the effects of the trance. Today, it was first that head-bobbing-forward-like-a-spring thing that I discovered recently. Except this time I was almost drooling and made some interesting humming noises. Glossolalia much? After my near-drooling episode I was directed back into the fetal-egg position of yesterday\u0092s experience.\r\n\n\n\nI found a special significance in my body positioning. Once curled up like a fetus I began to feel that I was actually within a womb. I could feel a protective egg-like enclosure all around me, and eventually began to sense that I was gestating in the stomach of the Earth Mother. I wasn\u0092t ready to come out yet, not ready to be born and face the world. Being in the womb I felt warm, safe, secure. I stayed in this position for more than twenty minutes, and during this time was able to keep the tryptamine trance state flowing. There was an endless flowing and recycling of tryptamine love back into me. I began to feel the umbilical cord, connected through my solar plexus, feeding me with life energy. At moments the trance would jump a notch in intensity, sending me out of body for the second time.\r\n\n\n\nSlowly the trance state was fading, and normal thoughts were starting to seep back in. I found I could rekindle the feeling by not getting sucked into my thoughts, just feeling the mind-warp. Finally after some experimental opening and closing of my eyes I realized that my arm was painfully asleep from lying on my side for so long. Moving stiffly, groaning, I came to\u0085 impressed at how long I was able to maintain the trance this time.\r\n\n\n\nAt T + 36 minutes I was integrated enough to begin typing this report, though the \u0093white\u0094 computer screen still looks rainbow to me right now. Still quite heavily effected. It is an exciting time. I am in a new phase of gestation, getting ready to be born again. What will the world be like? \r\n\n\n\nSession 6: April 4, 2008 morning\r\n\nHow deep does the rabbit hole go? As deep as you want to go, keep digging.\r\n\n\n\nSetting and music: Same as last time. Substance: Resin left over in pipe from smoking the mixture of DMT/5-MeO. Though from the smell and taste, effects and speed of onset I received, I would hazard that most of the DMT was gone and it was mostly just 5-MeO-DMT left in the pipe. Intention: Digging deeper.\r\n\n\n\nI took one large inhalation and as I wasn\u0092t being overwhelmed right away like I was used to, I went back for a second. The second was a big one, I could see that ball of brownish melted crystals bubbling furiously. Oops, took a little too much perhaps.\r\n\n\n\nRight as I was finishing my second inhalation, the phone rang. Oops again. Clearly I wasn\u0092t going to be answering but the ringing reminded me strongly of the normal world and normal concerns, and I became quite anxious as a result. I wasn\u0092t letting go like I needed to.\r\n\n\n\nThere is a certain aspect of 5-MeO-DMT that is like being smacked across the head with a brick. Or perhaps, like having the sun come down from the sky and crush me, folding me over and over again like a sheet. Heavy, heavy, incapacitating buzz. I flopped on my side into the fetal position again, but this provided no comfort. I was enormously dizzy and the tension in my stomach combined with the dizzyness to provoke nausea.\r\n\n\n\nI somehow ran to the bathroom in this psychedelic mindstate, and leaning over the porcelain alter purged. And purged. And purged. There was nothing in my stomach at all, I had blasted off soon after getting up and had eaten no breakfast. What was coming out of me was thick mucous or something, filled with the scent and taste of 5-MeO. I was reminded strongly of my Ayahuasca experiences. Bleh.\r\n\n\n\nI know that the reason I purged this time was because I wasn\u0092t comfortable letting go to the experience. The anxiety had to come out as the energy of 5-MeO is simply overwhelming. I overloaded myself this time. It was a pretty strong dose but I could have handled it fine had I remained calm and flowed with the effects.\r\n\n\n\nAfter the purge I was still strongly effected, but the flash of the experience had passed. I was able to sit meditatively and get into a good state of mind. I felt cleaned out and did not regret the experience in any way, though I should have prepared my setting and myself better before diving.\r\n\n\n\nSession 7: April 10, 2008 evening\r\n\nLight beings\r\n\n\n\nSet and setting: My room, nighttime. Preloaded with a tea of kratom, blue lotus, yerba mate, white pine, sweetgrass and sage. Energized and clearing, good for dreaming. Intention: Manifesting a home for myself and chosen companions.\r\n\n\n\nI loaded a little DMT into the pipe, but from the taste and smell became aware I was smoking quite a bit of 5-MeO-DMT resin from the bottom of the pipe, too. As I entered the trance I became aware of two entities. On my right hand side and quite close was one of the beings; the other was behind me and on my left side, at a little more distance. They felt very protective, like guardians. The one close and to my right was bathing the side of my head with sweeping motions.\r\n\n\n\nThe being on my right side started communicating with me through flashes of light and colour. The fluorescent light beside me was being played with, being made to flicker and flash in order to communicate. The beings sort of come \u0093out of the woodwork\u0094, the one beside me was manifesting as part of my bed, the fluorescent light, and part of the floor. He opened the top of my head and poured in information.\r\n\n\n\nI realized I could open a dialogue with these beings. I could ask them questions, and they would respond with these flashes of light-communication. I told them I wanted a home to live in with those I have chosen as a new family. I told them I want to have a partner. I want her to find me, or me to find her\u0085 I want us to find each other. A tight and beautiful little hippy girl whose heart melts when I look in her eyes. It doesn\u0092t hurt to ask, right?\r\n\n[Within three weeks of this experience, we had a home! Within two months I had found my sacred lover. I got everything I asked for.]\r\n\n\n\nI was curious about these entities. Remembering one DMT report saying that the entities can have gender, I asked both if they had a sex. The entity behind and on my left seemed to indicate it was a strange question to ask, and she dredged up some imagery for me\u0085 large breasts, large hips, direct stare. A motherly figure. The entity on my right seemed amused by the question. As if saying, \u0093Well we normally don\u0092t take that form anymore!\u0094 But he confided to being a male, if I wanted to think about it that way.\r\n\n\n\nThese entities, these light beings are here for me. To protect me and guide me. As I was coming out of the trance state I felt the desire to lie down, and asked that the entities stay with me. Please don\u0092t leave as I move around, I wish to stay in contact with you. They heeded my call, and when I lay down in bed I could still sense that comforting flashing of light indicating their presence. I did some relaxation/meditation techniques that put me deep into a dissociated state. Deep thinking.\r\n\n\n\nThinking about eyes. The eyes being the window to the soul. The soul perceives reality through our eyes. The patterns and colours in our irises is a visual representation of the frames and paradigms through which we interpret reality. Without those pigments and patterns we would see nothing but chaos and blinding light. We have to filter and make sense of reality, and this is what you see in peoples eyes. You see how they make sense of reality. A friend told me of a new band appearing in her eye, which would be a new mode or paradigm for viewing reality.\r\n\n\n\nEventually I drifted easily into sleep. My dreams that night were vivid, meaningful and I had better recollection that I normally do. Dreaming of being in some kind of crowd, or festival. And seeing Jess from a distance, sitting up in a truck\u0085 I blow a kiss her way. She smiles and waves at the friends around me, but does not seem to see me at all. There is a feeling of loneliness and separation.\r\n\n\n\nSession 8: April 17, 2008 evening\r\n\nSalvia preloading for smoking DMT/5-MeO\r\n\n\n\nI\u0092d first given three attempts at breaking through on just DMT. Each time I bounced off the edges of the trance state, not achieving liftoff velocity. There is at first a rising tone and feeling, but if I don\u0092t make it through then this quickly changes to a sensation of dropping and grounding out. The doses left me functional enough to move around without falling over. Which was good, because the main effect seemed to be purgative. I coughed and hacked all kinds of sickness out of me. It was cleansing, but didn\u0092t take me where where I was trying to go. I wanted to break through tonight.\r\n\n\n\nFelt a strange calling towards Salvia, knowing subconsciously where the bag of leaves was and not needing to search for it, simply reaching behind me and pulling it out of the hidey-hole. It has been many months since I last danced the divinorum. At this time I was still feeling the afterglow from the DMT.\r\n\n\n\nI took two large, dry leaves and folded them, placing between my cheek and gum. Slowly they soften and can be chewed. Slippery Salvia saliva tastes bitter like chewing green tea. I spat the quid and liquid out when it seemed appropriate, after several minutes of chewing. A perceptual shift was becoming increasingly evident. Hard to put a finger on what, exactly, had changed. Perhaps a little of that Salvia gravity was becoming noticeable.\r\n\n\n\nSo I loaded a little bit of mixed DMT and 5-MeO-DMT into the pipe, and I do mean just a little bit. Tiny grains. After filling my lungs, there was no doubt about achieving liftoff this time! The oncoming rush was annihilating me, and I think I became quite panicked, resisting the onset.\r\n\n\n\nThings are a little fuzzy in my recollection here, but I ended up on the bed sideways being twisted and pulled into the blankets. I was twitching and rolling around a lot, that I remember clearly. The twisting sideways sensation I would attribute to the Salvia. The emotional tone of the experience was one of fear. Fear and a sense of illusion, of trickery and something somewhere laughing at my predicament. For me, adding DMT to 5-MeO-DMT shifted the tone of 5-MeO from terror to bliss. Adding Salvia to the mix seemed to reverse the effect, dredging me down into terror with an irrestistable gravitational vacuuming.\r\n\n\n\nThe effects lasted a long time. I can\u0092t say exactly how long, but it took a good 30 to 45 minutes before I would consider myself \u0093integrated\u0094 again. The afterglow of the tryptamines combined with sublingual Salvia left me slipping and being pulled through damp thought corridors at high speeds. Dancing auroras of light and energy surrounded me. The feeling was oddly dream-like and unreal. When I finally came out of the trance, I was drenched in sweat. Sleep came easily and my dreams were extremely vivid all night.\r\n\n\n\nUsing chewed Salvia before smoking the tryptamines seemed to destroy the lucidity and clarity of the tryptamine flash. I have difficulty bringing anything back from this experience. It was certainly intense but I\u0092m hesitant to try again.\r\n\n\n\n[\u0085]\r\n\nThat\u0092s all folks, thanks for reading. You might ask, what impact did these experiences have on me? I feel they gave me guidance and insight at a time when I was feeling lost, lonely and anxious. They are life affirming experiences, showing me glimpses of the unplumbed depths of my mind. As the late, great Terence McKenna said, \u0093The imagination, the inside of our heads, really is the most vast frontier imaginable.\u0094\r\n\n\n\nReminding me, everything that happens is within the highest good. Reminding me to trust my heart and intuition. To have a comfortable experience, I must accept that I am experiencing what I need to experience. I must surrender to the flow of life. Letting go of the fear inherent in diving so deep leaves me instead profoundly open to giving and receiving love."

        "report_text": "Friday 13:00: After about a week of planning my \u0093dealer\u0094 and I are getting ready to embark on an adventure of epic proportions. We pack the car and do a final check of essentials. We plan to attend a psytrance/music festival and consume some of and sell the rest of the following, over the 2 nights 3 days of the festival:\r\n\n\n\n20 tabs LSD\r\n\n30grams shrooms\r\n\n5 gram extracted mescaline\r\n\n500mg of 2c-b\r\n\n5-6 grams MDMA\r\n\n500mg DMT \r\n\n3grams Ketamine\r\n\n\n\nWhat I ended up consuming myself:\r\n\n\n\n5 tabs LSD\r\n\n10grams shrooms\r\n\n1 gram extracted mescaline\r\n\nabout 100mg of 2c-b\r\n\n1.5 grams MDMA\r\n\n3 hits DMT (smoked, not sure of dosage, but I was fuckered up)\r\n\nand lastly 6 bumps of K.\r\n\n\n\n15:00:\r\n\nWe arrived set up tent etc. and consume 2 grams of mushrooms each. They come on fairly quick and seem to be nice and mellow. The rest of the afternoon was spent hiking in the mountains surrounding the venue. We meditated on a rock at sunset and I felt good about obliterating my mind.\r\n\n\n\n18:30\r\n\nUpon returning to our tent the music had started and I was feeling very cool, my mind was at ease and my body felt good I had not had many visuals yet. We consumed another 3 grams of mushrooms each and 3 tabs of LSD. We decided to go explore the dance area. I could feel both the LSD and the mushrooms fighting for dominance and had to lie down. I explained to my friend \u0093dealer\u0094 who I will call D from here on.  I found a soft spot and lay back. As my body hit the ground it felt as though everything was sinking in beneath me (in a good way) as waves of euphoria and that tingly acid sensation washed over my body. I have no idea how long I lay there, but I traversed time and space in my mind, I was soaring with nebulas and dancing with the cosmos. I eventually felt energetic and jumped up, a head rush followed that can only be described as my soul trying to pop out my skull. \r\n\n\n\n+- 21:00 \r\n\nI found D, after roaming around like a madman for I don\u0092t know how long. He was happy to see me and handed me 2 more tabs of acid and gave me a cap of 2c-b. I downed them all. We went for another walk up the mountains. It was pitch dark so we needed to bring a torch. The torchlight on the grass was insane it kept jumping up and dancing in the sky.\r\n\n\n\nWe reached the rock we had meditated at earlier and I needed to sit down as I was feeling a little woozy. As I looked around everything seemed a lot more \u0093evil\u0094 than it was earlier, even D\u0092s demeanor had changed. I asked him something and he just mumbled back. I had a sudden fear that a demon or something had dragged me here to this rock. I kept seeing flashes of blood splattered every where, and I swore I could hear myself scream. I was breathing very heavily, and D said I should sit down. He took out some MDMA and said we should sniff some to clear the bad vibes.\r\n\n\n\nI sniffed 2 medium sized lines, and almost instantly felt like a purple cloud had descended on me. Everything was so happy and different to how it was not 2 minutes earlier. I could talk easier and we even hugged for a few minutes. We began talking about our lives and how him and I are so different, yet are the same people on psychedelics. I swear I could feel his thoughts at this point. I tried to explore this more but got a very sharp metallic taste in my mouth, and an intense headache. We decided we needed some water and headed back to the tent.\r\n\n\n\n01:00\r\n\nWe are back at the tent, and there are a few other people sitting around talking to the other people we met there. I was surprised at how easy I was talking to people. Eventually D decided we should all smoke some DMT. I have only done it twice before, and was a bit unsure, but we went into the tent and he took out a pipe a lighter and a small baggie of DMT. He said I should go first. He held the pipe and lit the small amount of DMT sitting on top of some parsley looking stuff. I inhaled deeply. The first taste was the distinctly acrid plasticy taste of DMT, I almost vomited but managed to keep it all in. I exhaled, but before the smoke had even left my mouth I could feel the pull of the floor. \r\n\n\n\nThe tent swirled like ice cream at a parlour and before I knew it I was engulfed in whiteness and marbled lines like the architecture of a distant world far beyond our understanding. I could hear singing/ringing everywhere. And could hear my name (although it wasn\u0092t, but I simply recognized it as my name). It was a woman\u0092s voice and I tried to locate it, but there were patterns swirling everywhere in my vision, it was getting hard to focus on anything for longer than a second before it moved away. There were pulsating (not correct word, but closest to what I saw) colours everywhere, bright yellows and oranges they were changing shades and eventually I managed to move past them and was met by a massive tower like structure, the woman\u0092s voice was coming from inside the tower. I tried to walk but was held back by something. The colours were fading and as I turned to see what it was the tent became clear again. I remember sitting up and I was sweating quite a bit. I relaxed for the next 10 minutes trying to understand what was going on. I tried to write down the experience, in point form but lost interest half way through.\r\n\n\n\n01:45\r\n\nI thanked D and left the tent to go walk around as I was leaving D shouted and asked if I wanted more drugs. I said I would take some with me in case we got separated. He gave me some more 2c-b and a capsule of MDMA. I took the 2c-b and went to the stream nearby to relax and try to think. I lay on the ground, I could hear frogs croaking, but they sounded like machines or something, I closed my eyes and focused on their croaks. They seemed to get louder until it was unbearable, I screamed and they stopped. In my head I imagined that my scream had ended everything.\r\n\n\n\nI wanted to see what I had done, as it was so quiet, I could not even hear the sound of the music, only my heartbeat. Instead I decided I would re-create the world in my mind. At this point I became immersed in my own mind, I was creating the earth like a god it was swirling masses of rocks and I compacted them. I formed mountains, I flew through canyons I was carving with my mind.  All in all I was the Universe, I was God, I was The God\u0092s, I could understand everything that had happened, everything that was to happen and why. I knew I had a place in the world, and that I was just as important as a god because I came from something resembling a god.\r\n\n\n\nI gripped the grass around me tightly and ripped up handfuls of earth. The ground was cold and damp, as I made the connection to what I had done, the frogs croaking became clear again, and I opened my eyes. The first signs of dawn were clearly visible as orangey pinky glows in the distance. I washed my hands in the stream and ventured off to find D. When I found him he told me I had been gone for about 3 hours. I was surprised as I thought I had been gone about an hour tops. We relaxed at the tent and spoke to each other about a lot of shit. \r\n\n\n\n05:30\r\n\nWe decided to go for a swim and clear our heads. I took the other MDMA cap and had another line, hoping to keep up a happy mindset as things were starting to turn nasty again. I stepped into the stream and my feet felt like they had been dipped in liquid nitrogen, the sensation persisted as I went in deeper. I washed quickly as it was freezing. While drying myself It felt like the towel was re-juvinating me while I rubbed it vigorously over my body. I felt great. I looked at D and we plodded off again. \r\n\n\n\n06:30\r\n\nWe returned to the tent and debated trying to sleep; we decided it would be impossible. We decided however that it was now time to go dance. But not before some K. I had a small bump. It burned a little. It was beginning to take effect almost instantly as it felt like my head was expanding and floating at the same time I lay down and tried to forget about it. I noticed small clouds in the dawn light of the sky, they comforted me.\r\n\n\n\nThere were disturbances in my peripheral vision, there had been all night. These were different though.  I suddenly felt very uncomfortable and my head started to \u0093float away\u0094 again, I looked down at my shoes and they seemed like I was looking through binoculars backwards. I immediately jumped up, wobbled and fell over again. I was kneeling with my head in my hands. I could feel my face moving further away from my head, I couldn\u0092t stop it. I was trying so hard to keep it from disappearing, I imagined myself running after it like a kid chasing a helium balloon. I cried out for D he came up and pulled me to my feet. He kept saying it would be ok, I believed him.\r\n\n\n\nHe helped me walk to the tent. I lay there for quite some time, playing in my mind. I eventually felt good enough to stand up, but for some reason wanted more K. I had another 2 bumps and collapsed onto the bed. For the next hour I was obliterated I can\u0092t even begin to describe the things that went on in my head. The tent wasn\u0092t real, I wasn\u0092t real. Nothing was real. I watched the Universe being born and then traveled through millions of years of the Universes development in split seconds. I arrived at the exact point I was at and jolted upright. I got up and needed to go outside.\r\n\n\n\n09:00\r\n\nI went to dance for a bit and found D sitting playing with one of those you open and it\u0092s a ball of interconnected plastic, and you close it and it like a star. He gave it to me and I danced with it. I felt so good, and could feel the MDMA slightly. I asked D for more as I was enjoying dancing so much. He gave me what was my last 2 capsules. I gobbled them up and went to sit down as I felt sick, they hit me so quickly, it couldn\u0092t have been more than 10 minutes. I jumped and danced for what must have been close to an hour. \r\n\n\n\n10:30\r\n\nI needed to eat even though I wasn\u0092t hungry, but I felt weak. I opted for some fruit, It didn\u0092t taste of much, but I could feel the goodness coursing thru my veins. After a fair amount of watermelon and some mango. I was ready to vomit, so I walked it off. I was feeling bouncy and lively, and danced for a short while, until my stomach started to cramp. I needed to lie down. I went to the first soft spot I had found the previous evening and lay there rubbing my stomach. It felt so good, and was helping a lot. I got up and went back to the dance floor D was gone. I went to the tent and found him sorting out shrooms to go sell. We sold shrooms and some acid for a while. \r\n\n\n\n14:00 \r\n\nWe got back to the tent after walking around and selling the drugs. We decided the best thing to do was to eat some shrooms and veg out for the rest of the afternoon. We both ate 5 grams each and lay in the shade waiting for them to take effect. Most of the acid was still going but everything else had faded, the MDMA was still giving me very nice euphoria.\r\n\n\n\nI felt the familiar leg spasms of mushrooms and the discomfort in my stomach. My vision started to go all soft and hazy, I realized my eyes were trying to close, so I closed them and voyaged into my mind again. I assumed D was going thru the same thing as he was quiet as well. I tried to delve into my mind and as I traversed the corridors of my mind it became apparent that I needed to change. I was a disgusting person, who had destroyed my life with drugs. I argued with this thought and figured it could go very awry at this point. I opened my eyes and the same \u0093evil\u0094 from earlier had returned. I was freaking out, I looked at my hands and didn\u0092t believe they were mine. I looked at D lying next to me, he looked happy with a smile on his face, I was jealous I wanted to be happy. I got up and went into the tent and lay down again.\r\n\n\n\nEverything was closing in on me, I could hear people laughing at me outside. The world was mocking me. I closed my eyes and tried to break through this funk. I came to the conclusion that I was feeling guilty because of all the drugs I had taken, and promised myself never to do it again. I couldn\u0092t have been very honest with myself as the feelings of anger and guilt grew stronger. D opened the tent and I almost fucking died of fright. He burst out laughing, and eventually so did I. I asked him if I could have more K to shift the focus of my trip. He obliged with 2 small bumps. I did one. The same feelings as before persisted, but they were looping in my mind, I could look at them from another perspective. I snorted the other bump and lay down again.\r\n\n\n\nThis time my mind collapsed in on itself, and I forget the details, but I remember the tent vibrating and the stretcher that I was lying on felt like pillows stuffed with polystyrene chunks, I rolled onto the floor, and lay on my stomach. My stomach started growling, and mumbling I tried to listen to what it was saying, but it was obviously alien. I even tried communication but failed. I was cramping severely, and in a wave of brilliance decided my stomach was grumbling. But then it spoke almost an English word. For the next however long I was confused, angered and worried about my stomach. I think I may have fallen asleep, because when I opened my eyes the feeling of the K was almost gone. The mushrooms had mellowed out and D was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\n\n\n16:00\r\n\nI ate some more food and prepared myself for the mescaline and impending vomit from the come-up. At this point I was unsure of proceeding with this ludicrous weekend. D convinced me that we had gotten this close to infinity that we had to go on. We spent the rest of the afternoon talking cod shit and mellowing out.\r\n\n\n\n18:45\r\n\nWe prepared ourselves mentally for the mescaline and I took 2 capsules which was about 500mg. We went to dance while we waited for the mescaline. I know it takes a while so I was not impatient. The shrooms were still going slightly and my visuals were pretty and soft like cotton wool spirals. We danced for about an hour, but my legs were starting to feel like lead so I sat down on a hay bail.\r\n\n\n\nI could feel the mescaline coming on slowly and felt anxious. It was like waves of warmth moving through my limbs. My vision was getting sharper and I tried to focus on a piece of hay, I moved it around and it left long lasting trails. I was definitely fucked on the mescaline. As I became aware of the high, I felt sick and ran off to a tree where I vomited. After I washed my face I surveyed my surroundings. I was feeling really happy and noticed a crowd gathering near the dance floor. I went over and there was a fire dancer show starting. I sat in awe for at least 45 minutes, the flames seemed like molten gold and amber being flung around and controlled by some magical force.\r\n\n\n\nI noticed D and called him over, he was well and truly high. He was also amazed at the flames and we sat talking about how it warmed our souls to see something like that. I asked one of the girls with the fire staff if I could have a go, she obliged. I focused myself and tried my best to look confident. I managed a few spins before dropping it. I returned it to her, and was quite impressed, D was laughing, as he reckons I made the dumbest faces.\r\n\n\n\nWe both walked to the dance floor and just swayed in the awesomeness of the beats. I had to go stand next to the speaker and feel the power of the bass. The speaker set-up was 65K turbo sound rig, and was fucking loud. I pressed my back to one of the bass bins, and closed my eyes. What came next was truly amazing. It felt like I was floating. I couldn\u0092t feel the ground at all I had to open my eyes to make sure I hadn\u0092t floated off. My visuals were getting more intense and people were melting and moving to the music. I focused on one girl in particular who was dancing like she was loving life to the max. I watched her for ages, she was a goddess, a nymph, my ultimate desire.\r\n\n\n\nI snapped out of it and lost site of her. I had to find her I plodded off and eventually was lost near the stream, I have no idea how I had got there. I lay down as I felt I might be a little overwhelmed. I faded in and out of this reality and into the next, Orbs of \u0093good\u0094 were swirling around my head, they were almost humming a peaceful tune, although I could have been doing this. I was in touch with myself, my inner beauty. I was electric, and amazing I felt like I could shoot lightning from my fingertips. I got up and had to find D to see if he was feeling amazing as well. He was at the tent.\r\n\n\n\n23:00\r\n\nWe had been chatting for ages about random things, and how psychedelics could really be the answer to a lot of the world\u0092s problems, if anyone had ever felt like we did they would never want to harm anyone else. Let alone destroy whole countries. I had another bump of K for shits and giggles, it didn\u0092t do much apart from give me some disturbing CEV\u0092s of flashing lights and lightning.\r\n\n\n\nD asked if I wanted to hit the DMT again, I agreed. I sat on the stretcher and breathed deeply, he held the pipe to my mouth I inhaled held it and breathed out. I could feel the smoke swirling in my chest and throat, I coughed and shattered my vision, I focused on one piece at it fell to the floor it was getting closer and I was almost right on it. I kept falling and put my hand out to stop myself but was stopped by something. I saw fractals of infinite complexity, lines so thin a million of them would fit into a single strand of spider web.\r\n\n\n\nI heard the woman\u0092s voice from earlier, it was very distant this time. I turned and could see nothing but pulsating glowing colours and architectural fractals. I turned once more and there she was, a woman naked and dripping water/mercury. She was pure, she was beautiful. I reached for her and tried to grab her hand, it was impossible to, she moved away as I moved towards her. I was getting frustrated, she whispered the word no. I felt happy as I knew now that she was unobtainable.\r\n\n\n\nSlowly the tent was coming back and I could hear ringing in my ears. I woke up slumped on the floor. D was laughing, and said I was doing some fucked up things, like growling and shaking. I lit the pipe for him, and left the tent so he could enjoy the privacy. I couldn\u0092t believe how awesome I felt. My soul was glowing with love and peace, it came of waves of euphoria that can only described as god touching me. I thought back to the feelings I had on the mushrooms, and could understand them more clearly, they were dirty and horrible. The mescaline \u0093explained\u0094 that I was not entirely ready for this weekend and that I was not to do it again as my life would indeed become dirty like those thoughts. It continued saying that I was experienced enough to do it, but that anything in excess is bad.\r\n\n\n\nI felt ashamed, and the presence grew stronger. I could feel love, pain, anger, happiness, and all my emotions as one emotion it was given a word by the presence but I have forgotten it. I was told that I have a lot to give to this world and should not let the pursuit of a \u0093high\u0094 stop me from being the best person I can. I agreed. I snapped out of it as D walked up behind me. He handed me another 2 capsules of mescaline and said he was going to go fuck out in the tent. I took them and decided to go do the same.\r\n\n\n\n05:00\r\n\nI awoke out of a haze of unconscious consciousness. I have no idea how long I lay there in tent for. I can\u0092t even describe the things I had done in my mind. I looked at my watch and freaked out, I had been lying there for the whole night. I think my bodies tiredness was too much to handle. I was still very clearly fucked on the mescaline and went to watch the sunrise. I yanked D out of his sleeping bag, and we went up to the rock. He was not talkative, and neither was I but we seemed to communicate without words. We sat in awe of the sunrise. He pulled out the rest of the K and I refused any more. He had a bump and we both just sat in silence for what seemed like ages, I could see ants working, bugs doing there thing, and suddenly felt guilty about work.  Which was the next day. I put it out my mind and continued to watch things going about their comical business. \r\n\n\n\nFor the rest of the morning we didn\u0092t do much apart from smoke a few joints and eat some food. D was convinced some of his soul had been stolen. I on the other hand felt like my soul had been given a second chance, another chance to be great. I told him he was being silly and that it was probably the K. He agreed, and started laughing. I said we should do it again next week jokingly, I think he almost fell off his chair, until I said it was a joke. He seemed very serious, and I was starting to feel uncomfortable. I said I was going to bathe in the stream. \r\n\n\n\nWhen I returned everyone was packing up, I helped and we left shortly afterwards. I was still very high in the car on the way home and watched as the scenery flitted by. I was relieved to get home, and have a shower. I felt like the shower cleansed me inside. I thought back to what the mescaline had told me and smiled. I knew I would be ok. I watched tv for the rest of the day until I fell fast asleep.\r\n\n\n\nConclusion:\r\n\nI feel I seriously over did it, but things like this don\u0092t happen very often. I will be taking a year\u0092s break from psychedelics, and hope to only do Mescaline and LSD when I start again. I came to the realization, that although psychedelics can reveal truths about myself and the world, it is still a drug, and will be used in the pursuit of a high. I vow never to look at psychedelics in this way again, and treat them with the respect they deserve."

        "report_text": "I am a 23 year old male, weighing 120 pounds, with an extensive background using a variety of psychedelics. I have combined MDMA with Trichocereus peruvianus twice in the past, with extremely positive effects. This was my first time attempting the combination of MDMA and Trichocereus bridgesii. I like the bridgesii cactus because it is more potent than the peruvian torch. Ten grams of bridgesii on its own is for me a good strong dose, equivalent in effects to about twenty grams of peruvianus. I am slightly insensitive to the effects of MDMA, preferring doses over 150 milligrams. I have one prior experience smoking DMT.\r\n\n\n\nSubstances, dosages and timing:\r\n\n\n\nT + 0:00 pure MDMA 300 milligrams\r\n\nT + 0:00-0:30 a handful of Trichocereus bridgesii cactus (about 6-8 grams)\r\n\nT + 10:00 2 large inhalations pure DMT\r\n\nCannabis smoked throughout and the odd bit of blue lotus (Nymphaea caerulea) as well.\r\n\n\n\nSet, Setting and Intent:\r\n\n\n\nA good friend arranged a Halloween psychonauting party. Costumes mandatory (I went as the village shaman), about sixty people in attendance, most of them on 300 milligrams of MDMA. Most attendees are highly experienced with psychedelics but we had a few first timers too, so we took care to make sure they were having a good experience and staying hydrated. Several people there were DJs and there was a 2000 watt stereo system set up, so the music all night was fantastic. Starting out with mellow electronica, fading into some nice psytrance while the MDMA is peaking, and mellowing back out later in the evening (well, morning technically). Even heard a little Enya thrown on the tables at around 5 AM.\r\n\n\n\nI had a bag of 50 grams of Trichocereus bridgesii that I was intending on sharing with several psychonauting companions as a complement to the MDMA we were dosing. In my experience, combining cactus with MDMA makes me feel like I am rolling along nicely for twelve hours. Just as the MDMA starts to ease off, the cactus will pick up keeping me at this beautiful empathic plateau for hours and hours. I handed out handfuls of cactus (ranging from about 5 grams to up to 10 grams) to half a dozen people, ate a good handful of cactus myself, and used the remaining bits of flesh in the bottom of the bag to give several more people \u0093just a taste\u0094. Not enough to effect them, judging by the alkaloid content. But the spirit of this plant is very powerful and it was more to connect us all on a group level, share a group tripping experience. You don\u0092t need a psychoactive dose to connect with the cactus, especially around other people. Especially if all those other people are on MDMA. The potential for contact highs and shared vibrations is enormous.\r\n\n\n\nMy intention for this trip was two fold, to connect with others deeply through an empathogenic experience, and to work on opening my heart chakra, sharing loving energy with those around me and remembering also to love myself. As always I found the line between \u0093recreational\u0094 and \u0093spiritual\u0094 use to be blurred in a situation like this. The kind of recreation I had in mind is a spiritual journey in and of itself.\r\n\n\n\nThe experience:\r\n\n\n\nIt took perhaps 45 minutes before I could feel the MDMA coming on, a nice smooth entry despite the high dose. Because I\u0092d been eating cactus too I just sat and rested a little bit to let the slight stomach discomfort and nervous energy dissipate. To eat the cactus we were just chewing up pieces of the dry flesh and swallowing them with water. The more you chew it, the faster it kicks in, if you can handle the terrible bitter taste while doing so.\r\n\n\n\nWhen the MDMA hit everything was definitely ecstatic. Myriad who has never done drugs before and is having her first experience on 300 milligrams of MDMA and a few tokes of pot, is blowing up hard. As am I. We hug each other very tightly and then kiss. \u0093I\u0092m a lesbian.\u0094 she then says, to which I reply \u0093That\u0092s alright! You\u0092re a beautiful lesbian, you\u0092re going to have girls all over you.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093I\u0092ve never had a girlfriend,\u0094 she says and I tell her I\u0092m sure that will change in the future. She really is stunningly beautiful. \u0093OMG,\u0094 she saws with a tinge of awe and amazement in her voice, \u0093We\u0092d never be doing this if we weren\u0092t on drugs!\u0094\r\n\n\n\nI spent a long time chilling with my friends Cala and Tom in their room, as we were feeling a bit overwhelmed in the main area of the party. All of us were peaking on the MDMA and the cactus was starting to affect us a bit as well. We had some great conversations, these are people I\u0092ve hung out with a fair bit but we\u0092d never sat down and had a good chat like this before. It turns out we have all sorts of things in common, the love of plants especially trees and of course also the love of funky psychedelic ethnobotanicals. \r\n\n\n\nI recall at one point being handed a log of poplar wood that Cala and Tom had picked up somewhere and spent some time infusing with loving energy. I couldn\u0092t help myself, I had to cradle the log like you would a cute little puppy dog because the feeling of loving vibration coming from the wood was so comforting. Cala gave us both back massages which felt amazing. At some point our other friend Kali joined us in the room and we ended up in a four-way reciprocal foot massaging cuddle puddle. \r\n\n\n\nAfter awhile I began to notice the pattern of blue flowers on the blanket taking on a life of its own, waving gently as if blown by the breeze coming in the open window. During this time we smoked a couple of joints of very potent weed, with some blue lotus mixed into one of them. The blue lotus adds a nice relaxing mellow vibe, taking away some of the stimulant edge.\r\n\n\n\nSometime later I went back out into the party to chat with others and smoke some bowls of pot. The MDMA was wearing down a bit, the peak definitely gone and I felt a bit worn out. But the cactus wasn\u0092t going to let go anytime soon. The combined effect was like I was still rolling at a good strong MDMA plateau, except I was a little more tired and there were definate visual effects going on. Lights and colours were heightened, as if the whole world had been rendered by Renoir or some other impressionist painter. It felt nice to just sit in a comfy chair, breathing in the serene calmness. I was totally mellowed out but at the same time wide awake, no hope of sleep, and still incredibly empathic towards everyone.\r\n\n\n\nBack in Cala and Tom\u0092s room, we smoked a nice joint the three of us and this other girl curled up together on the bed, under the blankets. None of us were sleeping but we all just lay mostly in silence tripping out on the patterns on the walls. There was a rainbow lightbulb screwed into the socket, which cast gentle patterns of colour on the ceiling and walls like stained glass would. As I stared at the colours I would see them shrink and grow and the shade would fluctuate, purple to red, red to orange, then back towards purple again. Bunches of dried herbs and some sticks and such attached to the walls cast strange shadows which shifted slowly in a liquid fashion.\r\n\n\n\nThe DMT Nightcap:\r\n\n\n\nMost people were either passed out, mellowed out, or gone home. But for some of us, the cactus was still running strong. It had been about ten hours since dosing. Star comes up and softly whispers to me \u0093Do you want to do some DMT?\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Definitely!\u0094 I reply\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Okay, follow me to the little room at the end of the hall.\u0094 Andreas and Condor come with us and we discretely depart the room, as Andreas only has a few doses left. The material is a clean white crystalline powder extracted from Mimosa hostilis root bark.\r\n\n\n\nOut comes the little freebase pipe, dedicated solely to DMT and already encrusted with much residue from the last time these people went crazy on DMT. Sitting comfortably against the wall with a pillow at my back, Star started melting down the DMT onto the walls of the freebase pipe. It was only my second time doing DMT but I was confident it would go smoothly and that I would be able to let go easily as I had the first time. \r\n\n\n\nAs Star held the pipe and heated it from the bottom with a lighter, a ball of billowing white smoke formed in the chamber. I drew in my breath, long, slow and deep. Held for a few seconds, exhaled, and immediately began another long, slow inhalation. This time when finished I held the toke in and settle back as the initial comeup is already setting in.\r\n\n\n\nI hear the DMT carrier wave, a sharp, clear and pure note of sound like a turning fork rung inside my head, which grows in intensity and rises in pitch as I begin to fall into the trance state. My thoughts are surprisingly completely clear and lucid through this. \u0093Follow the carrier wave\u0094 I tell myself, slumping forward slightly with eyes closed.\r\n\n\n\nThe DMT rushes over me in waves, the first wave makes me catch my throat a bit, an odd constricting and mildly threatening sensation. I concentrate on relaxing and just breathing. My breathing pattern falls naturally into a meditative pattern, deep inhalations pulling as much energy in as possible and then deep exhalations letting go of all the tension.\r\n\n\n\nI feel I am inside a living crystal, which pulses and resonates with glowing energy. It\u0092s not a \u0093visionary\u0094 experience (no elves, no landscapes, no parables), rather just intense sensations of colour and light, vibrating and fading, brighter, softer, brighter and softer again. Several progressive waves come over me putting me in a deeper and deeper trance state. I hear one of my guiding friends ask another a question in a quiet and gentle voice, trying not to disturb my journey. It doesn\u0092t disturb me at all, but I smile inwardly as complex moving patterns of colour are manifested by the sound of their voices. I am seeing what they are speaking as shifting and twisting colours!\r\n\n\n\nThere came a point where I knew the DMT had peaked, the waves started to become less intense, less involving. Just starting to come out of the DMT trance I felt exactly the way I feel on a good dose of ayahuasca \u0096 there was an emotional overtone, a feeling of subtle energies within me moving around. I felt compelled to open my eyes now, and when I do I simply stare in amazement at a little patch of carpet with some scattered bits of paper and garbage. The plain grey carpet is covered in beautiful patterns, fractal mandalas, star flakes in gentle reds and blues and greens, which shift and change as I look at them. Creeping and growing, expanding, shrinking. It\u0092s like a skin that rests right beneath the surface of all reality, these beautiful textured living patterns of life that DMT has opened my eyes to. \r\n\n\n\nDMT is the most profoundly visual substance I\u0092ve ever had the opportunity to experience. The strange part of the experience is that my mind stays so lucid, so clear, just like a deep state of meditation. There\u0092s no interfering sensation of being \u0093high\u0094 so all I can do is marvel at the light show and feeling of absolute ENERGY. How can this substance be so visual and yet leave me feeling like I am standing right there inside the patterns, a sober observer to the swirling energies on all sides?\r\n\n\n\nThe last waves of DMT are washing over me now, in between I feel almost out of the trip and have a strong desire to communicate what I had just experienced. I am awed at the power of this substance, and yet also at the very natural feel to it. DMT seems to swim through the brain like a fish in water, it doesn\u0092t feel like a drug, just intense life energy radiating, pulsing, shifting and reforming everywhere. There\u0092s a great feeling of wellbeing during the afterglow too, I feel totally revitalized and like my brain has been \u0093reset\u0094 and is running more smoothly as a result. Thoughts are crisp and clear and the ability to fall into a mild trance state using meditative breathing lingers after the initial DMT flash.\r\n\n\n\nNearly back to reality, I chat a few moments about what I\u0092d been feeling and seeing and then make my exit from the room before the next space monkey makes his entrance to the DMT world. The first words out of my mouth after smoking the DMT are a heartfelt \u0093Thank you.\u0094 I head upstairs and hang out, feeling chatty and social and enjoying the afterglow.\r\n\n\n\nThis DMT experience had a very different feel to the last time I did it. I would attribute this mainly to set and setting. The first time I did DMT I was in a natural forest environment with pleasant afternoon sunshine, and I took a little more time to calm and prepare myself before smoking the DMT. The resulting trip was one of deep connection to the earth. The second time was in a small, dimly lit room and I definitely got a stronger dose on this second trip too. The effects lasted longer and there were more waves than the first time I had smoked DMT. What was the same both times was seeing these amazing energy patterns underlying everything, the constantly shifting fractal patterns of life. Also both times I felt remarkably lucid and aware enough to remember everything that happened, even at the peak of the trip.\r\n\n\n\nThis combination seems pretty innocuous physically. Sensitive individuals experienced some nausea, but no one vomited or had signs of hypertension, serotonin syndrome or anything like that. It did take two whole days to return fully to baseline after this experience, mind you. This was unexpected, as Trichocereus bridgesii on its own seems to last 12-16 hours and I\u0092ve never felt an MDMA afterglow for that long. Everyone who had eaten both the cactus and the MDMA reported this lingering effect, even those who had eaten only small amounts of cactus. Some kind of interesting synergy appears to go on between these substances. The two days after the trip were very enjoyable, as everytime I sparked up a joint this wave of love and empathy would wash back over me. I also found I was very sensitive to the food I was eating. Meat and dairy products and any heavy food I found very unappealing. I ate a lot of fruit and grains, as this seemed the easiest to digest. On the third day I experienced an emotional crash (not unexpected with such a large dose of MDMA). By the fourth day several subjects including myself had developed a head cold. I think this combination might run down the immune system somewhat. Stay safe and happy tripping!"

        "report_text": "I had just finished Daniel Pinchbeck's marvelously weaved metaphysical memoir 2012: The Return of Quetzacoatl, and after vicariously experiencing all his psychedelic trips, shamanic rituals, and cosmic revelations, I was eager to take my own psychespiritualdelic journey. It had been months since my last trip. So I uncovered my last 3 tabs of LSD I had been saving, a very strong batch of Fluff, which has given me many wondrous, colorful experiences before. I tried to convince my friend Z to join me, but ever since she encountered demons deep within the underbelly of Boston's Charles River on an LSD trip, she has had The Fear.\r\n\n\n\nEven though I consider myself a pretty experienced psychonaut (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, 2C-B, 2C-E, 2C-I, salvia, mali, ecstasy, plus all sorts of combinations :), I had never experienced anything beyond my Self, any kind of Other presence, whether for good or for ill. And even though I saw it terrorize her mind, I could not help but feel envy for her experience, because after all the trips I've been on, I had never had a truly spiritual or mystical experience. The trip always just seemed like something going on in my head. So she stayed relatively sober while I put a tiny white strip of blotter under my tongue.\r\n\n\n\nI spent the next 30-45 minutes sitting around, smoking a bowl or two, and enjoying that familiar curious anxiety that slowly creeps over my consciousness as it begins to expand. We eventually left indoors, got in the car (Z was driving), and took the dog to the beach, which was just a few blocks away. Before we even made it to the sand, I was entranced by the sound of the surf. I remember telling Z that 'the sea is a symphony.' I let the waves wash my feet and ankles. I felt such a strong pull from the ocean. It felt so good. I considered going swimming, but lacking a bathing suit, my shorts instead weighed down with cigarettes, weed, glass, and DMT, among other things, I stayed on dry land. Z and I wandered around a little, smoked a bowl, and then she decided she wanted to go, while I decided to stay. I walked back to the car with her to coerce the dog into the back seat, and then they were gone.\r\n\n\n\nI found myself alone on the beach now. I could see maybe 25 feet in front of me before the ground disappeared into the luminescent haze of the sandy air above it. Despite this, the stars still shone incredibly brightly, and when I looked up at them, they danced and twinkled, forming some kind of geometric net that resembled the appearance of a canyon from directly above. It was slowly descending upon me but never reaching me, and when I looked down at the sand, the rocks seemed to be growing out of the ground beneath the surf, something which they actually do in certain areas, but whether or not it was happening here, something I still am not sure of, the phenomenon was at the very least heightened considerably.\r\n\n\n\nEverything around me was coming alive. This once-empty beach was now surrounding me with its presence. The street lights behind the dunes seemed to wax and wane, sometimes illuminating the haze into a brilliant artificial orange glow, sometimes seemingly disappearing altogether. The effect only added to size and distance distortions I was experiencing. Everything was moving, nothing was concrete. The haze created a small dome around me in which I could clearly see. It was my cloud of perception, and it followed me wherever I went, keeping me out of reach from the foggy unknown world beyond, where shadows and shapes were manifesting and disappearing at the same time.\r\n\n\n\nI found a comfortable seat in the dune flanked by two hills, and it was here that I smoked the remaining crystals and resin that was left in my DMT pipe. Right after I inhaled, long and slow, the haze intensified, and I could barely even make out the water in front of me. It was probably less than 20 feet away. The DMT effects were relatively subtle. First, the geometric net of the stars was noticeably more apparent and complex, but still following the same slow wiggly descent. Then, when I stood up in a moment of paranoia and saw my cloud of perception to be maybe 10 feet in radius, I had the distinct feeling that I was no longer where I thought I was, that I had journeyed somewhere entirely different. There were more shadow figures wandering in the fog now, though never coming into view, and as I passed a mass of beached seaweed, I remember thinking that it looked like I was clearly on some alien planet.\r\n\n\n\nMy mind was still accelerating, and the symphony of the sea was ever-present, slowly infiltrating my consciousness, though I didn't realize it at the time, finding distractions everywhere, and even though I knew on a conscious level that I was just on the beach at night, I also knew, both consciously and unconsciously, that I had stumbled into a place I have never been before, and this feeling was only intensifying as I wandered farther down the coast, to a land where the gradual slope of the dunes transforms into steep cliffs.\r\n\n\n\nThen, just as I saw another shadow figure, she saw me, and I saw that it was a mutual, simultaneous observance. She seemed to say something to me, and I seemed to respond. What was literally said or what it sounded like, I have absolutely no idea, but I realize now that she was bidding me to follow, and I was accepting. I began walking in her direction, which was roughly the same direction I had already been heading, but there was such a distinct presence out there now, an 'otherness' that was following me, surrounding me, but staying just outside of my sphere of perception. I kept looking around me, only to find my own shadow and the sound of my own footsteps, but it was as if I could almost touch it. I could feel it getting stronger. I was also entering an incredibly chaotic state of mind, a schizophrenic-like stream of consciousness where there were multiple voices and thoughts in my head simultaneously, and I could not differentiate one from the other, much less my own from my other.\r\n\n\n\nI found a spot on the cliff where the rocks jutted out, providing a small shelter if one were to sit right against the wall. I sat down here and began to pack a bowl of cannabis. Less than a minute later, I was fleeing from the site in panic, because I saw and felt the rocks above me begin to crumble apart. I ventured back to make sure the cliff was still standing, as I knew it was, and that I was just tripping face. I walked a bit farther until I stopped to lean against the rock. It felt so strange to touch it, and as I was gazing at it, trying to collect myself, the rocks again began to crack and crumble apart right in front of me. The unknown had now entered my sphere of perception, and matter was dissolving before my eyes.\r\n\n\n\nI again fell back from them in utter and complete terror. As I backed up, and as the fear grew, the cracks grew massive, climbing up the walls, until I finally calmed myself down, realizing it was being brought on by my emotions. I considered turning back at this point, but I knew I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I did. I was out there looking for something, and I knew I would find it if I kept looking. So I ventured farther, following more shadow figures in the fog. There were so many of them now, their presence still intensifying. I kept walking toward her ever-changing shape, and as she came into view, I saw that it was a stack of rocks, maybe three and a half feet high, but stacked perfectly among the rest of the stones on the beach. It struck me, and I remember looking at it, curious, but I did not stop, I kept walking, entering a still-higher level of schizophrenia. Everything was so jumbled, I eventually sat down against the rocks again, finally smoking that bowl. I was tripping so incredibly hard at this point, I remember telling myself and all the other voices in my head that 'I'm just sitting,' which made me laugh out loud when I made the connection with the Buddha, and just how ridiculous this all was.\r\n\n\n\nI began listening to the symphony of the sea again. I was being lulled into a trance. I did not realize it at the time, but it was her. She had led me there, egged me on, and she was singing to me now. Her voice was transcendent. Once in her trance, I found myself to be in a multi-dimensional sonic space. The rhythm and structure of her song created these pulsating, swirling rhythmic harmonies that were of a complexity so incredible, so beautiful. I have never heard anything like this before in my life. And I've been to the beach before, I've heard the sound of the surf crashing against the sea and sand. But never like this.\r\n\n\n\nI was shaking now. She was stringing me along one of these harmonic columns of energy, spinning, swirling, whirring, and then, right after a momentary eternity of silence, the string snapped, in unraveled, and I heard the deep, guttural roar of a massive wave. I knew it immediately when I heard it, and I wept at its beauty. Tears streamed down my face as I realized what had just happened. I heard a wave for what a wave really is. Not some rising hill of water that breaks on itself as it approaches the coast, but a huge, swirling formation of energy that journeys miles a minute in its constant cycle. As this all sunk in, I was still trembling, my pulse was tremoring, and I was gasping for air, and my body had just been sitting there this whole time.\r\n\n\n\nI channeled her and she channeled me, and the spirit of the water had led me there, against the rocks, where I could hear her sing. The rocks she had led me to were shaped perfectly to resonate the swirling, spinning divine rhythmic harmonies of the waves deep in the sea. I could ride her voice for miles. It was one of the most powerful experiences of my life. Everything was clear now, I was lucid in this spirit realm, and I was in harmony with her, dancing with her. The presence I had felt encircling me was now a part of me. I spent a long time out there, hypnotized and enraptured by her breathtaking roars and elaborate cadence. It resonated within my soul. She was a part of me now, and I was in ecstasy.\r\n\n\n\nI eventually wandered back to Z, who was asleep. I woke her up to tell her my story and smoke a freshly packed bong. Even blocks up from the coastline, I could still hear her, and I could feel her song below my feet. We got in the car and drove around, and after some meandering throughout the sleeping city, pulled on to a street where a massive tractor trailer was trying pull into an alley. I felt the pulsating in my soul again, but this time totally different, and all of a sudden the power lines above us got ripped apart, exploding in a cloud of white sparks. I yelled at Z to back up, because if the pole was coming down, it would've come down right on top of us, and then again, a second explosion. Luckily nothing fell, and everyone was alright. I told her I anticipated it, feeling it before seeing it, and she said she felt it, too. We thought it might have been a small earthquake, but we haven't been able to corroborate this conjecture. In all likelihood the truck got caught on one of the wires and snapped it apart. This had a similar apprehensive feeling as the wave, but it was more of a cosmic punch to the soul than a trance-inducing song.\r\n\n\n\nWe spent the rest of the night wandering between the beach and the car, and wherever I went, whether it was an open beach where the sound didn't resonate the same way, I could still hear her, I could still hear the swirling get faster and faster until it snapped and unraveled, exploding in the crashing of a wave. I was eventually lulled to sleep by her when I finally lay in my bed well after dawn. When I woke the next day, and even now, her song still resonates in my soul. The sea sounds forever different to me now. I went back to the same spot I was in the next night, but this time in the normal, material world, where both the haze and the stars were less visible, the rocks were no longer stacked up, and I could only barely hear that whirring energy resonance. But it was still there.\r\n\n\n\nThe most astonishing thing to me about this whole experience is the fact that I actually got a response from a seemingly unresponsive universe. I was out there looking for spirits, or some kind of 'other,' I don't even really know. My normal day-to-day life feels different now. Even though I was in such an altered state, as this surely ranks among the strongest trips I have ever had, and even though I am a little unsure about the linear progression of events, I have no doubt about what I heard in that eternal moment. She sang to me."

        "report_text": "The following is a personal account of my ultimate trip in deep psychedelic inner-space. Over the past 13 years or so, I\u0092ve been always looking to reach the next level. I\u0092m talking about drugs of course. I\u0092ve tried almost every mind altering substance known to man, but nothing came close to the insane experience I had on DMT a couple hours ago.  I tried DMT for the first time in 2003 in Isla Vista, CA (Small beach city close to Santa Barbara). It was in the wee hours of the morning after a night of heavy drinking and rack\u0092n lines of coke. I was chilling with my boys at this dudes crib, blazing chron and pounding fodeez when the random guy on the couch woke up from his faded stupor and packed me a bowl of some herb and this yellowish powder (DMT). He said it\u0092s the craziest shit he\u0092s ever tried. In my circles I\u0092m not really know as the guy who would back down and be a pussy and say NO! So I said What Tha Fuck, let\u0092s do it. I lit the shit, inhaled and then it hit me.\r\n\n\n\nI was immediately transported into another fucking dimension. It was like the space trip in 2001 A Space Odyssey. I was being launched to space and traveling through this vortex black hole tube thing at an extreme velocity. I was seeing lasers, graphs, geometric shapes and other images. I felt a foreign being take a hold of me. It was alien-like, almost evil. It started to communicate with me. It told me that they put that bark on earth for mankind to find it and smoke it to communicate with them. It was our way to find out the secret, the meaning of life. That being made me realize that we are just puppets in a grand play. They are light-years ahead of us and much more intelligent. The alien said that Earth was their planet and they allowed us to live there. That shit just blew my mind, I could not believe what I was experiencing. \r\n\n\n\nI\u0092ve tripped out on a bunch of shit, like mad liquid acid, shrooms, special k, mescaline, e, meth and other crazy euro shit during my extended stay in Budapest Hungary, for example the hocky-puck. It looks like a round, thin, black screen and you put on your tongue like a tab. It\u0092s made of mushroom oil extract and mescaline. I have to say it\u0092s one of the craziest and most demented things I\u0092ve done. It was the most powerful thing I\u0092ve done at that point and even that did not even faze my latest DMT trip. I used to go raves every weekend for a number of years, doing shit. I was always that kid who took too much. I\u0092ve been to the far reaches of the galaxy, but this shit put me through to the other side.\r\n\n\n\nThe second time I smoked DMT was yesterday at my pad in Hollywood. My buddy and I made our own shit this time. I ordered that shit online from one of those ethnobotanical websites. Its scientific name is Mimosa Hostilis, it\u0092s root bark that comes from South America. We did our research on all the Teks we could find at the time and we decided on the Lazy-Man\u0092s one. It was fairly easy to make, but a tad bit tedious. I knew what I was in for, so I remained patient and optimistic. Although at one point, I had some serious doubts about our skills in the preparation of psychoactive substances, not to mention following directions. \r\n\n\n\nMy buddy, we\u0092ll call him paranoid alien or PA for simplicity\u0092s sake, he\u0092s a seasoned veteran tripper, but he\u0092s never tried DMT before. He was eagerly waiting to try our creation. A couple days after extraction, I tried smoking it in a ghetto homemade crack pipe made from a broken glass bowl and some foil.  I didn\u0092t feel shit! It evaporated really quickly. Afterwards I tried to freebase it off of foil, that didn\u0092t work as well. I had the same problem, it evaporated to fast.  I started to worry that we fucked up.\r\n\n\n\nSo I thought if I snort it, there\u0092s no way it can evaporate and I\u0092m bound to feel something. I made myself a phat strap and racked it to the head. The shit burned sooooo bad. It felt like somebody poured habanero hot sauce up my nostrils. After about 10 minutes I started to feel it creeping on. It wasn\u0092t strong by any means, but rather gentle and tamed. I had really minor trails and visuals and a slight body high. It was kind of euphoric like coke, but with weak visuals. It was nothing too crazy, but at least I knew it worked. I went to bed thinking maybe I should smoke it out of a bong with some weed like the first time I tried it.\r\n\n\n\nNext evening I grabbed my FADED, 2ft, 3 chamber, double bub, color changing glass, bong. Now this piece is the mother of all bongs. It has 3 chambers and an ice catcher. So the smoke filters through 2 sets of water and some ice cubes, so I get the smoothest hit possible. DMT can be harsh at times. I turned down the lights, lit some candles, and popped in this Moonshine Trippy Visuals DVD to watch it on my 52in SHARP AQUOS LCD, with a Pioneer 4 tower speaker 5.1 surround sound system. I put a layer of bud on top of the screen in the bowl, then took the corner of a business card and dipped it in a pile of DMT crystals. I sprinkled it on top and then covered it with some more bud, to not light the crystals directly. \r\n\n\n\nShit hit me as soon as I cleared the bong. The initial rush was insane. The walls were not only breathing like on acid or shrooms, but everything in the room was so colorful and vivid that it seemed like I was in a cartoon, all the objects in the room were outlined in dramatic colors. I have 2 picture of New York above my tv which came alive and crawled up my ceiling. The candles made it look like the city was on fire. The popcorn ceiling was like a huge microchip. Outlined like a colorful graph. I felt like I was in the Matrix. Then I closed my eyes, to see what it would look like on the inside. I reacted to the brightness of the tv and the candles as well as the different colors they created. I didn\u0092t see any aliens this time, but I felt that alien presence and it was pretty crazy to say the least.  It was jaw dropping incredible. I was just sitting there in awe, gawking at every trippy object in the room.\r\n\n\n\nA few minutes later I tried the same method, but with a regular weed pipe. I felt it a little bit, but it was really ineffective compared to hittin the bong. That same evening PA tried to smoke some using the same method, out of his small weed pipe he had at home. It didn\u0092t really work for him and he gave up after 2 attempts and went to bed. I hit the sack as well and we both agreed that we\u0092ll give this a proper go tomorrow. \r\n\n\n\nThe next evening, took place the most insane trip I\u0092ve ever had in my life!\r\n\nLet\u0092s keep in mind folks, that I\u0092m a seasoned veteran and I always like to push the envelope to see how far I can go. I gave PA a little bit less than what I had the night before. We popped in 2001 A Space Odyssey and PC cranked up some Floyd on his IPOD. It was the crazy scene where Dave goes into this colorful hyperspace bliss hovering over planets. We also lit candles turned on some black lights and placed some trippy flashing blue lights in the room. I also happened to have this colorful disco light ball, called the Cyclotron that reflects colorful images around the room.\r\n\n\n\nPA took a phat rip, closed his eyes, laid back and was speechless for the next few minutes. I felt like I had to join him on his magical journey, so I packed myself a bowl too. Like an idiot, I tripled the dosage I had the night before and I mixed it with this danky kush I got earlier. I NEVER imagined I could ever experience that psychonautic level. It just hit me like a ton of bricks. It took control almost immediately. I sensed the higher power of greater beings or aliens. Through an advanced telepathic communication with them, I perceived that I was going to be shown something and taken for a wild ride. There was no fighting this thing, there was no way to break free. Just like Johnny Depp said in Fear and Loathing and I told myself on my previous trips, \u0093Go with it, don\u0092t fight it, it will only get worse if you fight it.\u0094 I told myself the same thing now, but there was only one problem, I COULDN\u0092T FIGHT IT OR GO WITH IT! \r\n\n\n\nI was in the void. The room exploded with color! I was blasted to another dimension, again, only this time I was convinced it was a one way trip. I catapulted through space with great speed, traveling over scary alien worlds, knowing that there\u0092s no turning back. With every passing second I felt like I was going deeper in this fantastic world. My body was nowhere at that point. I lost complete feel for my body. Like a K-Hole hundred times worse than any I've been in. It was a total out of body, more like out of mind experience. As I was going deeper I tried to fight it, to regain some kind of control. It was useless. \r\n\n\n\nThe room was just incredible! Sensory fucking overload on all levels. My neurotransmitters were burning, pulsating and screaming.  Cyclotron made it seem like I was in a spaceship with spinning lights, then the candles had this burning effect on my spaceship, I was on fire and I was going to crash. There was way too much stimuli to digest. Then it felt like something cracked in my head, like I burst a blood vessel or something. I could not handle the madness that surrounded me and I reached the breaking point. I somehow had this feeling that if I give up now and crash, then my body will die in the real world. It was no use, it had a hold on me like nothing I\u0092ve experienced, and we we\u0092re going down.\r\n\n\n\nMy life flashed before me during this part of the trip and I thought I was going to die. It happened so fast that I thought to myself \u0093Ok Z, this time you really done it. You\u0092ve been pushing your luck for so many years, thinking you can take anything without consequence, and now this shit is going to do you in.\u0094 It wasn\u0092t only that, but it felt like I was being punished for undermining this powerful drug. It was like fuck you bitch, you can\u0092t hang wit this shit, who do you think you are?? You think you\u0092re hot shit?? Well try this on for size motherfucka!!!! BLAM! IN YO FACE!!\r\n\n\n\nI crash landed and that\u0092s when shit went white. I\u0092m on the other side now. PA said that my body was convulsing and my heart felt like it was about to explode, then I laid still. At this point I\u0092m completely retarded. I cannot function shit. I start floating up and see myself from above looking down on my body and PA trying to revive me. My girlfriend Sugar-Butt runs in the room screaming. They\u0092re both above me now, stroking my face and telling me that everything\u0092s going to be ok and that they will get me some help.\r\n\n\n\nThen everything started moving fast again, fast forwarding on the events after my death. The ambulance came out and took me to the hospital. I was in a laboratory, lying on a table, waiting to be sliced open and experimented on. PA and I were all over the news. He made it out safely, but I took too much and fried my brain. Our story became a really hot affair. We we\u0092re made examples of for kids to not do drugs or this is what will happen. It felt like the damn Truman Show, like an evil game show. My whole life was being filmed for the rest of the world\u0092s entertainment. From me as a small fetus to my last hit of a lethal DMT weed mix. It was pure torture, because there was no way out. I felt like I was stuck in an eternal prison in my delusional nihilistic mind. I was an observer, whishing I can regain control of my body. I was now solidly plugged into this tremendous channel of never-ending information.\r\n\n\n\nMy family and friends we\u0092re all crying at first, but later laughing, saying \u0093You got what you wanted\u0094. I saw my funeral go down. As I was lowered in the grave I looked upward at everybody staring down at me. It felt like I was swirling down the drain. At this point in the abyss, I remembered reading about how the human brain releases DMT before you die. I thought that this had to be it, this has to be the final moment of my puny meaningless existence. I felt pathetic. I couldn\u0092t believe that this is how I\u0092m going out. Fuck dat shit! Everything turned black.\r\n\n\n\nI believe that this is where I flatelined. I hear PA\u0092s voice very faintly. I start seeing some traces of color and hear some ambient noise. Is this hope? Did I found a way out? I was thinking if there is hope for survival, I would be a comatose vegetable in a nuthouse somewhere. There was no way I would come back normal. I had to try though. I tried really hard to open my eyes, but I couldn\u0092t. The colors started getting brighter and more intense and the noise more apparent. Felt like I was rising upward to go back to where I came from. \r\n\n\n\nI see shapes starting to form around me. All of the sudden I was back in the spaceship traveling through an insane colorful vortex. I was submersed in synaesthetic sea of visuals, moving up the spiral at high speeds. Alien beings were attacking my spaceship and trying to prevent my escape. They were trying to get me! To my surprise PA is in the spaceship with me shooting aliens and clearing the way for us. FUCK YEA! Like all great intergalactic tag-teams, Captain James T. Kirk and Mr. Spock., Han Solo and Chewbacca, Space Ghost and Zorak, we we\u0092re battling the forces of evil on the new frontier, not to conquer, but for self-preservation. I saw a school of yellow tail swimming around and for some reason I had to go fish, so I threw my line and started to fish for yellow tail during my high speed chase through the alien infested vortex that was going to bring me salvation. Hmmmmm\u0085real smart.\r\n\n\n\nThe Light! I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. It started getting brighter as we blasted up. I knew that this has to be the way to get back to the other side. It just dawned on me that I actually broke on through to the other side, like Jim fuckin Morrison and now I\u0092m heading back to my world. We got out just in time, I felt like another second in that psychedelic hell and I would have been toast.\r\n\n\n\nI was able to see clearly now and realized what just happened. PA was about to call the cops, because he thought I might not survive this.  My visuals were still off the charts insane, but I had a sense that I\u0092m back now and all I have to do is sit through this and I\u0092ll be fine. I reassured PA that I\u0092m cool now and he doesn\u0092t have to call an ambulance. I was still hardcore tripping at this point. It felt like the teeth-grinding, dragon breathing down my neck, frenzied peak of an intense liquid acid trip. It was starting to leave me now. WOOOOOHOOOOO!!!!! DEMON BE GONE!\r\n\n\n\nThe sheer joy of being alive was overwhelming. For the next half an hour I could not stop talking about my experience. I could not believe how far I went. That trip was the craziest shit I\u0092ve ever heard of or experienced personally. I\u0092m also convinced that at one point, I died and came back. I\u0092ll never go beyond that point. Too bad I don\u0092t have a scale so I can measure the amount I took, but any more and I would have been perma-fried, or wait am I???\u0085..muhahahhaahah\u0085..muhahahahah\u0085just kidding.\r\n\n\n\nThis was an earth-shattering psychedelic experience that made me realize how important my sanity is. I would rather die than experience life looking through a distorted window of reality, where I cannot engage my environment. I think I got an insight to what a catatonic patient on a permanent bad trip must feel."

        "report_text": "I recently wrote an experience report entitled Entirely Immersive (Report ID:57936), whereby I smoked DMT for the first time. The following experience is related to an oral dose of DMT taken a few weeks later with the hopes of eliciting a more cerebral trip, and that it did!   I am referencing my last report for those who might wish to compare the two.\r\n\n\n\nI decided on a 50 mg dose of DMT rendered orally active with a 3 g dose of ground Syrian rue.  The setting was as near to perfect as I could dream up, a small cedar lined yurt with a gas stove fireplace, nestled at the foot of the mountains on a crystalline lake.  The morning sky was dark with snow and a powerful wind was blowing down from the mountainside past our yurt, leaning heavily on the giant firs and spruce surrounding us. My girlfriend and I lay nestled by the fire in our cozy little cabin, with candles set about the room. \r\n\n\n\nMy girlfriend was going to sit for me and had set aside her day to do so. She understands me well and is a talented sitter, so along with a perfect setting, I was feeling confident going into the experience knowing that my needs would be met, no matter where the journey took me. We began the experiment at 11:30 AM a couple hours following a light breakfast.\r\n\n\n\n00:00:  I formed the powdered rue into pellets by blending it with a very small amount of melted butter, and swallowed them with water.  I didn\u0092t taste a thing.  A subtle light headedness began to come on after about a half hour, and I was surprised there was no nausea.\r\n\n\n\n00:45:  I ate the yellowish DMT crystals in a gelcap, and then sat scrawling notes in my dream journal, waiting for effects to come on. Changes were noticed after only about 15 minutes and at 30 minutes were more clearly pronounced. It felt like a slight drunkenness, being mostly physical, marked by a lack of balance and coordination. This may have been primarily the MAOI.\r\n\n\n\nMy girlfriend suddenly and unfortunately realized she forgot to arrange her absence from work, so we reluctantly headed into the village with me in the passenger seat and her sober, so we could pick up a cell signal.  As we made the 14 mile journey, the trip began to come on, and it felt surprisingly like mushrooms.  An oceanic feeling swept over me and the mountainsides began to take on a crisp colourful appearance. The subtle hues of nature were blooming forth in palettes of pink and yellow and green.  I noticed it getting harder to hold conversation. There was a bit of nausea, but overall I felt quite serene.  Little did I know how this would all change.\r\n\n\n\n01:45  Returning to the yurt, I find it is no longer easy to write my notes, although the trip is still quite mild. We sit and talk for a while and I notice strong, therapeutic psychological effects coming on. I muse to my girlfriend that I have to prevent my ego from squashing my creativity and that I recognize I am more insecure with myself than I would like to be.  These ideas persist, and within another half hour, I am remarking on how pushy this substance is. I don\u0092t feel like I\u0092m in control, and feel the power of the substance taking hold.\r\n\n\n\n02:00 \u0096 False Comedown\r\n\n\n\nThe effects begin to subside, and I suggest to my girlfriend that I am probably beyond the peak of the trip and I might be on the downswing.  I pull her in for a big hug and as I hold her, I notice a beautiful shimmer in the wood grain of the wall.  Apparently I\u0092m not over the peak yet \u0085 as it turns out \u0085 not even close.\r\n\n\n\n02:30 \u0096 Liftoff\r\n\n\n\nThe open eye visuals begin to increase, the room glowing in electric colours and mercurial reflections.  Things begin to look digitized and liquid and remind me of my smoked DMT experience, only milder. My girlfriend looks astonishingly beautiful to me, not that she isn\u0092t always, but now \u0085 even more so.  I feel the trip rushing forwards, as if I\u0092m on an accelerating train that I have no control over. \u0093Damn this is pushy babe!\u0094 I said.  When I close my eyes I am submerged in a liquid soup of colourful visuals, and my mind is racing, racing, racing with powerful emotions. I am filled with happiness, sadness, dread, euphoria, humor, fright \u0085 all at the same time.  As much as I am fascinated, I begin to hope it won\u0092t get any stronger.  Sound Tribe Sector 9 was on the stereo \u0096 Live at Home \u0096 and the choice couldn\u0092t be better for tripping. The music no longer emanates from the speakers, it fills the room as a spatial entity. I ask her \u0093Am I peaking yet?\u0094.\r\n\n\n\n03:00 \u0096 Primary Fuel Cells Deplete, Secondary Cells Activated\r\n\n\n\nThe open eyed visuals are now approaching those of smoked DMT and it is difficult to keep my eyes open as it is thoroughly overwhelming. The room is alive with colours, and it is  truly a beautiful sight.  I feel a strong male presence, not an entity, a presence \u0085 and the message is clear: I am not in control here. I recline back on the futon, dragging my fingers repeatedly back through my hair, my eyes are gushing water, and my mind feels like it is hurtling through an emotional vortex at 1000 miles per hour. My teeth are chattering and I am releasing a long nonsensical utterance, which amounted to nothing less than internal energy trying to escape my body.  I am both terrified and overjoyed.  I close my eyes and I am swallowed whole, and my girlfriends calming words seem miles away and they are echoing, as is my own voice.  Despite my terror, I mutter from beyond the depths \u0085 \u0093 highly recommended\u0094 which causes her to burst into a fit of laughter.  \u0093Oh God \u0085 am I peaking yet?\u0094.\r\n\n\n\n03:30 \u0096 Terminal Velocity\r\n\n\n\nI am receiving so many messages I can\u0092t possibly process them all. I am inundated with visions of friends and family, and emotions of all types.  I feel like I am being ruthlessly pushed through a growth process, no \u0085 dragged \u0085 by the face. I am overcome with a sense of thankfulness for the life I have and everyone in it, and tears of joy and humility stream down my cheeks.  \u0093Life changing\u0094, I mutter \u0085 \u0093absolutely life changing\u0094.  This is all I can manage.  I feel humility in a way I have never felt it before, and despite my fear, I know it is all for the better.  \u0093Oh God, oh God, please tell me I am peaking\u0094.  My physical self is cycling between euphoria and sickness, and the body load coincides with my psychological state. As I navigate the darker depths of my soul, I am overcome with the need to vomit and defecate, and I am burping up large quantities of gas. As euphoric joyful thoughts arise, the feeling subsides and I am swept away by a tingling warmth. My limbs feel so heavy at times I can scarcely move.  I am starving and I shove slices of an apple in my mouth like a crazed caveman, barely able to handle the simple task myself.\r\n\n\n\n04:30 \u0096 Atmospheric re-entry\r\n\n\n\nAlthough I am enjoying this in some perverse sense of the word, I begin to want it to stop. It is just too much to bear.  As anxiety and exhaustion set in, I ask for Xanax, but my sensible sitter asks me to hold off if I can, because we don\u0092t know the effects of Xanax with an MAOI.  \r\n\n\n\nLike a spaceship re-entering the atmosphere, the final minutes of the trip were like burning through a wall of sheer terror. It was the most difficult part of the trip, the most exhausting, but very abruptly it began to tail off, and within another 15 minutes or so, I could see the light of consensus reality once again, as if dropping by parachute under a clearing sky.  I was relieved indeed.\r\n\n\n\nIn no uncertain terms this trip blew me away.  It is the single most intense experience I\u0092ve had, and I\u0092ve had quite a few. It was unforgiving, ruthless and downright ferocious, yet uncomprehendingly beautiful.  I am damn glad I had a lot of psychedelic experience under my belt before going through it. I also have my faithful girlfriend to thank as she was integral to the control of this situation.  It was a beautiful life changing experience for me. It left me feeling profoundly thankful for my life, my friends and family. I was given clear visions with respect to my life, where it is headed, and what I should and should not be doing with it.  I have been humbled. I will do it again for sure, I just don\u0092t know when."

        "report_text": "Jan 18th, 2007\r\n\n\n\n\t\tFirst N,N - Dimethyltryptamine Experience\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWow!! Its been a long time since I first started looking for this elusive compound! Almost 4 years by my accounts. I remember first reading the amazing, sometimes glamorous stories about this entheogen posted on Erowid and thinking, I wonder if I'll be able to ever experience the divine visions that these people are describing. Well it seems like tonight was finally the night. By some bizarre, but definitely meant to be turn of events, I was contacted by a new friend of mine who told me he had met someone who might be selling DMT. This friend of mine is currently attending PAVI (Pacific Audio Visual Institute) and was walking near his school two nights ago when he was stopped by a man he did not know. The person was friendly and questioned my friend about PAVI because he had seen the PAVI knapsack my buddy was wearing. They got to talking about music and some how, but not incomprehensibly so, drugs came up in conversation. My buddy told this stranger that he had been given some good liquid LSD recently from a musician he knew and it turned out that this random stranger was also the person who had supplied that liquid to the musician. Already an odd turn of events... This person (I'll call him M, my friend being L) candidly mentioned that he had some liquid still sitting at his abode and also some DMT he was looking to get rid of. He also mentioned that he only had a 3 day window or so to move the product, otherwise he wouldn\u0092t see more of it for at least a month. So L gets M's number and proceeds to call me later that night with the good word. Of course I'm excited to hear about the opportunity, however, I've heard this story again and again from various people claiming to be able to procure the sacred entheogen. So I decide not to get to enthusiastic and wait for a more solid confirmation. \r\n\n\n\n\tNow on to the present day.. I receive a call from L telling me that he has contacted M and that he would be able to meet up at around 7pm this evening. I instantly jump at the opportunity and am out the door and to the bank in minutes. We arrive at M's house where he kindly welcomes us into his home. Right away I can see he is a musician by the numerous instruments and keyboards he has strewn about his living room. We sit down, I introduce myself, and we get straight to business. He tells me that he has 1/2 a gram of organic DMT left, and that his roommate had an additional 1/2 gram that he may want to sell. Unfortunately the roommate was away at the time, so he would not be able to make the sale on his behalf. M sells me the 1/2 for $150 and I hold the sacrament and admire its purity. Unlike the other organic sample I have, this extract is nearly white, with a very slight orange tinge to it. M tells me that this extract is the finest he has tasted in many years, and that it is definitely on par with synthetic DMT. Excellent... what more can I say? I feel like jumping in and trying it right now! But no, you must learn proper smoking technique to use this substance. He hands me a paper with some typed up notes on it that states (according to Terrence McKenna, and various other such authorities) that freebase N,N should be smoked with a normal cannabis pipe and not a glass freebase pipe. Now this is slightly confusing to me as I've read many accounts on Erowid stating that a glass freebase pipe is the only efficient way to smoke. It seems like this newly suggested method is a little complicated, with layers of ash mixed with dried mint leaves being required. I ask if M might be able to demonstrate this smoking method to me, but he replies that his roommate G is more knowledgeable and that I should wait about twenty minutes for his return. Twenty minutes for an invaluable lesson? Of course I'll wait. G soon arrives and seems to be a hurry. Ends up he has a large paper he has to complete this night for his PhD. I understand the importance and tell him not to worry about showing me the technique. G says, 'Not a problem, just let me set up my room and I can show you. I\u0092ve turned as many as 100 people onto this sacrament and I would be pleased to help you.' Nice guy! We get to his room where he turns down his lighting and shows me how to layer the ash and mint leaves, so as to create a screen that will cause the DMT to vaporize, not incinerate. My heart begins to race with anticipation as he hands me the pipe and tells me to prepare my lungs for inhalation. Now let me state here that I have been completely sober for sixteen days prior, with the exception of perhaps 2 drinks on separate nights. My lungs have forgotten how to handle and hold cannabis smoke and have gotten 'soft' so to speak. Nonetheless, my mind has cleared up considerably and I feel very alert and receptive. I am ready for this. As much as my heart is pounding like a runaway jackhammer in my chest. I... Am... Ready. \r\n\n\n\n\tI inhale and exhale two times to try and expand my lung capacity. G fires the lighter and says 'Go'. I press my lips to the pipe and slowly, steadily inhale as much as I can. At first taste, this substance tastes sort of plastic-like, but I was prepared for this taste. Also the tobacco in the pipe (we actually didn\u0092t have any mint, so we used rolling tobacco) begins to irritate my cleaned out lungs. I hold the toke for about three seconds when G tells me to just exhale and take another one before the remaining DMT in the pipe burns up. I knock down another hit with a little more effort this time. The damn tobacco smoke is really irritating my lungs and I start to fear that I would mess up this first experience because I wouldn\u0092t be able to hold my smoke. This is when my body began to vibrate with a strong force. The familiar carrier wave I sometimes experience on ketamine begins to start ringing in my ears. I was able to take one more small toke before my hands start to shake and I pass the pipe off to G. He takes the pipe and quickly leaves the room to let me enjoy the trip in peace. My heart is still pounding but I know that it\u0092s going to be ok from here on in. My eyes and my head become very heavy and there is a strong force, not unlike salvia gravity, pushing the back of my head and shoulders against the wall. I slouch back, not seeing any open eye visuals, and close my eyes. BEAUTIFUL!! Intense geometrics are swirling and gliding all around for as far as I can see behind my eyes. The hues are mostly darker shades of violet and blue and the patterning continues to emit from a central point, yet every time I try to focus on that point, it evades me and the waves of coloured mesh dart off to a different angle. As the colours begin to shift in spectrum to more green and oranges, I notice a very strong feminine presence. A great tranquility is awakened within me, and I start to see a naked female body form out of the geometric shapes. The spirit does not have skin, but is given shape by the flow of colours that move across her heavenly flesh. She seems to be subjectively about fifteen feet away and curled up in a sort of loose fetal position, and I notice that it is as if I am looking at the spirit from the top down. The colours are now becoming yellow and red shades and this point, as the plant entity unfurls in the most beautiful, graceful fashion. Elegant tendrils of light and smoke loop and coil from her opening hands. As she begins to ascend up towards me, I am filled with a deep reverence for this mystical experience that I have been gifted with. I realize that we are never supposed to solve the mysteries of such unbelievable visions, so as to retain some form of child-like perception, even in our ageing adult lives. This perception is a privilege that just about all people forget about and some psychonauts take for granted. I have met many veteran users of psychotropics that consider their visions to be nothing more then entertainment since they\u0092ve seen them so many times and have still not 'figured them out'. They forget that the alternative perspectives they experience are meant to shed new light on current personal, social and global issues. Alternate perspectives allow us to take a step back, see the bigger picture and take a breath before attempting to tackle problems that once seemed too big to right or too solidified to resolve. As the goddess drew nearer, I cherished every moment of my first visions of this dimension. When the ethereal woman was right before my eyes, she reached out with her hand and touched me between the eyes with her index finger. She spoke into my mind with telepathic words and said \u0093Welcome to this realm\u0094. I was very aware of my opened third eye and felt all of my chakras realign in response to the holy touch. At this point, the shades of colours in my trip had turned to dark red and purple hues and I felt a greater perception of my body. I knew that I would be returning to baseline very soon, but was very satisfied with what I had seen and learned. I opened my eyes to see G returning to the room. He sat down beside me and asked me to tell him what I had felt. I conveyed my story and thanked him again for all of his generous help. \r\n\n\n\n\tIt is now nearly five hours since I smoked the DMT, and I still have a very calm aura about myself. I have called several friends and relayed my story to them with great excitement. I\u0092m looking forward to being able to share this precious material with them and seeing what things they learn from their encounters. In conclusion, I was like to encourage anyone who is looking for DMT and who has not yet found it to carry on the hope that one day it will find you when you are ready. Be open to the experience, be safe, and share your teaching with others so not just you, but all of society can grow in a positive direction."

        "report_text": "I have recently finally had what I consider to be the full DMT experience as I understand it to be. In fact, although my experience had astonishingly many similarities to other trip reports I have read and heard, it seemed to be far more elaborate and unbelievable than any trip report had ever conveyed to me, understandably of course. The best description I have heard of the overall internal sensation during the experience is that of Terence McKenna's when he remarks that: \r\n\n\n\n\u0093Somehow, it felt like I was finding out that thing that you cheerfully assume you can't find out.....but it felt like I was finding out.\u0094 \n\n\n\nThis is what it feels like. Like I have reached the core of all worldly understanding and there seem to be much more highly intelligent entities there who seem to want, in some way to teach me the secrets of the world. \r\n\n\n\nAnd this notion of secrets of the 'world' here is one of the major distinctions that I have been able to make between 5-Meo-DMT and DMT. 5-Meo seems to provide, for a large portion of those who take it, including myself, the so called white light experience; a dissolution of one's self into pure connection with all other things, and sometimes a complete loss of contact with any 'thing'. The experience is very much that of a transcendental aspect akin to the philosophies of the east. \r\n\n\n\nHowever, DMT is what I'm considering very 'worldly', in that it is not, in any way as I can tell a transcendent experience in the previously used notion of the word. If I want to talk about transcending dimensions or something on that level then the word might apply, but in the spiritual or pantheistic sense I do not think the word applies to DMT. DMT seems to me to be much more about the world of visual and sense perception and the lessons that seem to want to come across in the experience tend to be of a more practical 'worldly' nature (seeming largely to have to do with evolution of linguistic capability). \r\n\n\n\nJust to clarify, when I say 'worldly', referring to DMT, I very much do not mean grounding, earthly, or anchoring. These words seem more like antonyms of DMT rather than synonyms. It is actually far from any of those in my experience. It is very alien. It is very other-worldly, and very uprooting. All I mean by 'worldly', as the best word I could come up with, is that it seems specifically not to relate on any immediate level to the transcendent experience akin to 5-MEO. \r\n\n\n\nNow, I would like to shift to my actual experiences \r\n\n\n\nI now have experience with 1 toke, 2 tokes, and 3 tokes, and I have to whole-heartedly agree with Terence on this one, when he claims that it's all in getting myself to take the 3rd toke. I  may feel completely strange and exceedingly weary about taking the 2nd or even 3rd hit, because I already  feel really loaded, but if I can maintain myself long enough to get that 3rd one in, it seems to make all the difference. So, I will discuss my experience at the 3 levels and let them speak for themselves. \r\n\n\n\n[ah yes, I think it is important to note at this point, that I have never experience any sort of visuals or hallucinations from any dose of any other substance, not high-dose LSD or mushrooms or ayahuasca. All I have ever seen being my closed eyes has been darkness] until now... \r\n\n\n\n1 toke - At this level the space behind my closed eyes becomes almost immediately multidimensional. I can clearly see a animated, domed, geometrically patterned visualization, largely made of colored & patterned equilateral triangles. After a few minutes this began to fade in and out of itself. Nothing much else occurred. In researching some of the literature surrounding DMT I found this experience to be much more like the notion of the 'chrysanthemum' in Gracie & Zarkov's commentary than that of Terence McKenna's. They describe it as: \r\n\n \n...circular interlocking patterns in exquisite colors. It has been described as looking at a vaulted ceiling or dome. \r\nIf you did not 'breakthrough' to the levels described above, this 'chrysanthemum' pattern, as we call it, is all you will see. It is worth the trip, too. \r\n \n\n\n\nI agree it is well worth the trip to see this, as it is astonishing and beautiful, but has no comparison to the other levels. \r\n\n\n\n2 tokes - At this level the 'chrysanthemum' gives way to what I describe as a very crowded shopping mall (not really but I think it gets across the notion of the atmosphere). Now, one thing I noted is that there has never been any thrusting forward or any notion of traveling at rapid speeds, the transitions between the states have always seemed to happen very seamlessly. I am just suddenly immersed in a space that I had not been, several seconds previous. The crowded shopping mall, as I call it, was very elaborate and brightly colored; colors I had never imagined or seen. The structure was very large and entities seemed to be moving rapidly this way and that, very much seemingly going about there own business, not paying an attention to me, as if I was not anything new or interesting to be encountered in that world. And then after a few minutes of being in this space, I was back, quite astounded and quite ecstatic at my first experience of visual contact with non-identifiable entities, which in this experience seemed to be of the nature of floating orbs of energy, with an orangish hue. \r\n\n\n\n3 tokes - This was the one that threw me for a curve. I had taken my first toke when the torch lighter decided to go dead. I was trying to take more hits, but the DMT space started to envelope me and I laid back and began my examination of the 'chrysanthemum'. As it began fading in and out of my vision, my companion returned to the room with a second lighter. After some deliberation about whether or not I would take the other tokes I decided that if I was going to do this I was going to do it the whole way. So with that firm resolve in my mind I took the 2nd and then the 3rd toke and lay back. This time the geometry's of the structure taking place around me were not so simple, not so kiddy-math, as the previous spaces I had encountered. The entire architecture around me was imbued with sacred geometry. The space was so vast that the architecture just receded in all directions farther than I could see. I have done some minor readings on sacred geometry and it had always just struck me as something that was neat math that could produce intricate and beautiful patterns, but faced with these kinds of structures, built literally out of all of these geometries in ways that boggle the mind. \r\n\n\n\nI had the notion that these structures were not only the most impressive thing I had ever seen, they were impossible, not in the sense of impossible objects like from Escher or other artists, but impossible in the sense that nobody could ever actually make these with physical tools manipulated by bodily limbs. These structures had to have been thought into existence, but it seems to me that I could not have supplied the thoughts to create these structures, so where did they come from. Certainly, it might be possible to invoke Jung's notion of the collective unconscious, but still that is not how it seemed. It seemed, simply and straightforward like a place, intentionally built by someone\u0092s or something. \r\n\n\n\nAnd what do I know, there were beings that seemed to inhabit this place, that seemed to come off as vastly more intelligent and vastly more capable. And here is what startled me most of all. They wanted to teach me what they knew. They were interested in providing me with secret knowledge. The only caveat being that I had to decide right then, at that moment, to give myself completely over to them. \r\n\n\n\nI hate deadlines and I hate being put on the spot. Now, how often in my life does this opportunity occur, however. A group of alien entities in another dimensional space who are highly intelligent offer to teach me that there secrets granted that I give myself over to them completely right then, without understanding the full implications of what that meant to give myself over to them. Hmmm.... I have never had to thing so rigorously in all of my life about every aspect of what might be the consequences of an affirmation of such an offer. I could not do it. My mind could not think quickly enough to rap around the ramifications of such an action, and given that I couldn't think about it fully enough, I decided it would be best to decline the offer, hesitantly and extremely unfortunately. The entities, briefly surprised by my decision, then began discussing among themselves whether or not I should be allowed this opportunity in the future or if I had decided and that was the end. \r\n\n\n\nThe deliberation seemed not to be leaning in my favor and I decided no to sit there in silence and late the fate of my future learning be decided without my input. I imparted to please allow me to come back and learn at a slower pace. I informed them that I was finding it difficult to make my brain process information at the speed required to comprehend all that was happening around me and that I thought that future experiences would provide me with more ability to navigate the space properly. They discussed this briefly and decided that this was acceptable, given one more decision that I still had to make immediately. They demanded that I promise to be EXTREMELY serious about this learning process; that I could not treat this as I have tended to do my other studies, of which I am truly interested but tend to be exceedingly lazy when it comes to actually putting rigorous thought into. I must agree that if they allow me to come back as a future student that I will not chince out when it comes to putting full effort into interpretation and implementation. This again, was a very serious proposal. It meant overcoming my tendencies toward laziness of mind, relatively so. I struggled with this for some time and embraced it as an opportunity to better myself in my habits on top of an unrivaled learning opportunity. I agreed to the seriousness of my future studies and with that the entities were satisfied and the experience was over. \r\n\n\n\nHowever, the ramifications of my decisions were still strong with may and I lay there uncontrollably shaking for several minutes thinking about what I had agreed to, no longer from the effects of the chemical, but simply reeling from the implications of the experience. \r\n\n\n\nWell, I know that was certainly long. But it was more complete for having been so, although of course not fully complete. \r\n\n\n\nI do not claim any answers regarding what happens in the DMT space, but I have noticed astonishing similarities between the natures of people's experiences that tend to lead towards the hypothesis that this is less of a state of mind thing, and more of an objective experience than any other drug experience that I am aware of. (though that cannot be ultimately confirmed)\r\n\n\n\nExcept for salvia, perhaps... This is something else that I am extremely interested in; people's comments on the similarities between the salvia & DMT experiences, because they seem to have many of the same facets involved. To me they have felt almost identical except for the nature of the visuals, and the crowdedness of the space."

        "report_text": "Some Background\r\n\n\n\nI've been fascinated by the psychedelic experience since I took my first RoboTrip 4 or 5 years ago. Since then, I've ingested as many different psychedelics as I could get my hands on. At first, I used very little discretion. I took DXM almost weekly for quite a while (with excellent results). I ate morning glory seeds and HBWR because they were easy to obtain. Then I moved on to mushrooms, research chemicals like 2C-I and 2C-B, and mescaline from San Pedro.\r\n\n\n\nI have had excellent trips on all these substances, but it was with my discovery of LSD that I found a true psychedelic ally. And, in spite of the drought that many people have experienced looking for LSD, this chemical fell into my hands frequently over the last couple years, and I ate a lot of it. And I can confidently say that I was able to learn much more from one or two LSD experiences than I did with all other psychedelic drug use combined.\r\n\n\n\nNow, all this experimentation did not come without a cost. Sometimes I found it very difficult to cope with the changes that these drugs forced within myself. Certainly, they didn't help me become a more productive / efficient / clear-headed human being. When I discovered LSD I mostly cut all other psychedelic drugs off my menu. What was the point of experiencing depersonalization, mood-swings, loss of concentration, and minor HPPD-like effects if I wasn't learning anything?\r\n\n\n\nSimply put, I feel like my mind and body have been through plenty of abuse in the last few years so I need to choose my poisons sparingly.\r\n\n\n\nHowever, there was one substance still left on my list. And how could I put a cap on my psychedelic drug use without having tried DMT? I was not really interested in being shot into hyperspace, but Ayahuasca reports sounded fascinating. But it just so happened that a friend had some pure DMT he was glad to share, and I found some monoclobemide as the MAOI to activate it.\r\n\n\n\nMy girlfriend, who is nearly as experienced with psychedelics as I am, also was very interested in oral DMT. So we had set aside a night to eat it together. The setting was her house, with nobody around and no distractions or worries.\r\n\n\n\nThe Trip\r\n\n\n\nAt around 10:00pm we each ate 150mg monoclobemide.\r\n\nAt around 10:30pm we ate 50mg DMT each.\r\n\n\n\nBy 11:00pm I was starting to feel 'something'. Yep, I noticed a mood lift and somewhat playful character enveloping me. Also, my body felt tingly and warm. We turned off the television (we were watching the start of The Cable Guy which just happened to be on) and decided it was time to focus on the effects.\r\n\n\n\nI suggested we boost with 30mg more DMT, because I knew that 50mg would be somewhat of a threshold experience, and by now I was pretty sure I wouldn't have any bad reactions to the stuff. She wasn't feeling anything yet, but she agreed to boost.\r\n\n\n\nSoon after taking the booster dose, bringing us to 80mg each, I noticed the carpet was starting to crawl just a bit. Yep, this was beyond placebo. Looking around the room, things looked a little brighter.\r\n\n\n\nI got on the bed and laid on my back. The two lights on the ceiling had caught my attention. I couldn't explain why, but there was something about them. I felt drawn to them. Shortly after this the ceiling lost its texture, stretched out to look kind of like a sky, and the lights looked like they were suspended in space. They were acting like some kind of entity, yet at the same time they really weren't doing anything.\r\n\n\n\nI was feeling *very* relaxed and calm, so I rolled onto my side and closed my eyes. I noticed there were some patterns, like snowflakes arranging themselves in fractal formations. At first it was faint, but soon I fell into somewhat of a trance and it became more vivid. Then I noticed that this was only one layer of my vision, and there were several more layers. Another layer came into focus, and this one was brightly colored, containing at least twenty hindu-looking deity-things dancing in a line. It was like Lord of the Dance, but with super-trippy creatures dancing instead of Michael Flatley and his crew. Then I noticed there were not twenty, but several thousand of these creatures. For some reason this realization hit me with a wave of intensity, and I felt a very strong pull on my body (almost like Salvia, but not as dark and creepy) like I was about to launch into hyperspace and join these dancing creatures. Keep in mind that not five minutes ago I was at a very mild ++ experience, if that. The force and sudden power of what I was experiencing took my by surprise, and I tested the waters by trying to put on the brakes, so I would know if these sudden waves of intensity could be controlled or not.\r\n\n\n\nIt turns out they could not. Opening my eyes provided no relief at all. Everything was still there, but I couldn't see much of it, aside from the occasional set of glowing eyes which popped out of parts of the room, mostly in my peripheral vision.\r\n\n\n\nI turned over and told my girlfriend that things were really getting intense, but she still wasn't feeling anything. She wanted to walk around the house and turn the lights off, and I went with her. The walk seemed to break the pull that was acting on me, and instead of being pulled by the power of thousands of hindu gods I was able to focus on different objects in the house and connect with their energy. I don't know how this transition occurred, but it removed any anxiety I had and the trip was now truly fascinating.\r\n\n\n\nWe went back to the bedroom and she lay down on the bed, apparently very tired and probably extra-relaxed from the DMT. She still felt nothing and wanted to go to sleep and leave me to trip out on my own. I told her, 'If I were you I would no go to sleep. You might wake up in an hour or two, completely out of your mind.' But she did lie down and close her eyes.\r\n\n\n\nI also closed my eyes again, and felt another trance coming on. This one was not threatening, which is strange because the images I saw were actually scarier. I saw wolves exposing their fangs, claws scratching at me, gargoyle-looking creatures, and some entities that looked rather demonic. I could sense their presence, and I was somehow in touch with them. But they had no influence over me like the hindu dancing gods did. They were basically just images.\r\n\n\n\nNow these trance states were really strange. Several times in the trip I would go from a + or light ++ and shoot up to a much higher level of intensity. I would not call this a +++ or ++++. It was just the cyclical rhythm of the waves of 'trance' coming over me. During these periods it was very easy to close my eyes and enter a strange universe, which was usually very chaotic. I was trying to see if I could make contact with perhaps one entity rather than seeing a bunch of rapidly changing, flashing psychedelic images, but it was not to be.\r\n\n\n\nThen I heard my girlfriend say, 'There are so many eyes!' She was looking all around the room, and she looked very overwhelmed. There were tears in her eyes and she sat up straight in the bed and kept crying. When I looked at her face it changed shape in a weirder way than I have seen people's faces change on LSD or shrooms. It got huge and lumpy and then looked kind of elfish. I thought this was strange and not really all that cool, but it didn't bother me. I guess a similar thing was happening to me from her perspective though, because she said the entities were stealing my body.\r\n\n\n\nNow, I believe that her trying to fall asleep was a mistake. I have read about the cycles of DMT metabolism and production that occur naturally in the body, and supposedly right before you fall asleep is when this occurs the most. I believe she almost fell asleep and then all the DMT hit her at once. Because, as she descibed a little later on, apparently a huge number of entities entered her body and exploded. She desribed it as an 'assault' and apparently it was relentless.\r\n\n\n\nI suggested we take a walk around the house, because that seemed to help me. So we went upstairs and she sat down on the stairs while I wandered around for a little while. A backpack on the floor turned into some kind of lion, briefly. I looked into a dark doorway and I knew there was a lot going on inside that dark room that I could not see. I tried to will myself to go check it out, but I could not. I knew whatever was in there would be too convincing and I was still completely unsure what the intention of this drug and the forces/entities it brought forth were.\r\n\n\n\nMy girl was having her mind blown, but not in a good way. It was too intense. She described meeting an alien family that was desperately trying to communicate with her, and they took control of her senses (vision, hearing, touch) to try to do this. But all she heard was buzzing and all she felt, apparently, was pain. She said they were learning as the trip progressed and stealing her energy.\r\n\n\n\nBecause somehow I had broken free of the anxiety and overwhelming nature of my own trip, I tried to give her many words of advice.\r\n\n\n\nShe described many, many playful and mischievous entities which were constantly bothering her, but she didn't know what they were trying to do. I remember reading on the Ayahuasca forums that many experienced travelers believed these were a simple nuisance, and that they should be ignored because they distract from the true lesson of the trip. Since I was totally lucid (she was too) I told this to her. I also told her many other suggestions on how to reclaim her stolen power, and what the point of her troubles might be. Some of these things seemed to help her, and she nodded and seemed to incorporate my knowledge into her neverending struggle, but apparently the entities she was facing were much more experienced in this realm and they were constantly tricking her and outwitting her.\r\n\n\n\nI realized, this is no psychedelic trip. Mushrooms, LSD, mescaline... those were trips. They altered the nature of the existing world around me. Oral DMT brings another universe, or several universes simultaneously, right to my doorstep. It takes experience to navigate several dimensions simultaneously. I believe DMT is a serious tool for shamans.\r\n\n\n\nNow, I didn't have the same problems my girlfriend did. I already believe that objects have their own energy and consciousness, even if it is a shared energy and consciousness, so I found my ability to witness and feel this extremely fascinating. Everything looked so beautiful and alive. I looked at a painting of a forest and the trees were dancing in it. They just looked so happy to me, and I could feel a small part of myself projected into their world. I didn't personally find this threatening at all.\r\n\n\n\nThe visuals I experienced were not the strongest I've ever had. I've had slightly more vivid CEVs on mushrooms, and stronger OEVs on a few other trips. But what I saw was totally beautiful, bright, crisp, and alive. I can't compare the visuals to other psychedelics. I previously thought LSD visuals were realistic but this takes the cake.\r\n\n\n\nMy body felt absolutely better than on any other psychedelic drug I've ever had. No nausea. No muscle tension. No body load at all! In fact I felt fluid, buzzing with energy (but not tense stimulated energy, flowing energy), and warm and fuzzy. However, I can't say that I learned anything from this trip, except about the nature of DMT and the potential for parallel universes. I did not meet my power animal. I did not get any words of wisdom from a cool entity. I did not have any great realizations. Perhaps it was because I spent much of my trip trying to keep my girlfriend grounded and comforted.\r\n\n\n\nThe comedown was both gradual and rapid at the same time. The strong effects dropped off almost instantly after about 4-5 hours. But the mild effects remained until I fell asleep (which happened very easily, and I got a long and restful sleep... hooray!) and seem to be still with me today as I write this.\r\n\n\n\nThe depth of DMT was not what I expected. I was almost like a sober traveler in a strange world. For much of the trip I could have been in public and not had a problem, except for my massive pupils. I will do this again, at the same dose, but in a much more 'ritualistic' setting. I don't know if I will bring anyone with me or not.\r\n\n\n\nAbsolutely fascinating stuff. No negative effects to speak of, except the possibility of not being able to handle the intensity. If would suggest having a mushroom ego-loss experience under your belt before trying oral DMT, because DMT will rip away the ego much quicker and more unexpectedly than shrooms will. This didn't happen to me, but it almost did, and even though I've lost my ego on psychedelics before, I wasn't quite ready for it. I would not suggest this for anyone seeking a recreational trip. Yes it can be lots of fun, really enjoyable, but I don't feel like *I* was the one controlling a DMT 'trip'. There seems to be something, or lots of things, on the other end... and every time one takes DMT they get to trip too.\r\n\n\n\n.... 'whoa, earth! It's so crazy, matter bonds itself together, it's so normal! Trippy!' ..."

        "report_text": "Recently I was lucky enough to find a small amount of DMT, which happened to be enough for 9 experiments. The first was a small dose, probably less than 10mg, smoked with poor technique on some foil. The second was an 85mg oral trip, taken with moclobemide, which resulted in an overall ++ experience with several breif periods when I would get sucked into a very intense, strong +++ trip. I also experienced limited, weak entity contact during that experience. I wrote trip reports for both of those experiences.\r\n\n\n\nMy 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th experiences all occured within a two hour time period, each time with between 5mg and 7mg smoked on a small amount of cannabis. I found that experience, or series of experiences (if you don't think I'm cheating by counting them as seperate), to be highly enjoyable.\r\n\n\n\nSo a few nights later I decided to get a bit deeper into DMT space. But, I only had a small amount of DMT left. 24mg to be precise. This may sound like a small amount of DMT to you - and it certainly is. But if there was one thing I learned a few nights earlier it was that a little bit of DMT goes a long way. One thing to consider is my technique smoking the DMT on top of cannabis. I am positive that this potentiates the DMT experience by an unquantifiable degree. I have no doubt that it flavors the experience, and I'm not sure if this is for the better or not. I would probably not smoke a much larger dose of DMT combined with cannabis for fear of too much anxiety and confusion during the trip. Regardless, I had a truly amazing experience the way I did it.\r\n\n\n\nThis evening I also planned to leave less time between smoking DMT. If I remember correctly, I smoked my 24mg of DMT in two parts, each approximately half of the material sprinkled on a small bowlpack of moderately potent cannabis. But I was quite stoned before I even started smoking the DMT so I was certainly fully affected by cannabis during the DMT experience. I should probably also mention I took an unweighed dose of Piracetam, for the first time in several weeks, about 10 hours earlier, probably around 1.5 grams.\r\n\n\n\nI took my first hit... holding the flame above the DMT as I drew, to burn it as slowly as possible and melting it rather than setting it on fire right away... hold it in for 15 or 20 seconds... and blow it out slowly, savoring the oddly delicious flavor of the DMT/cannabis vapors. I repeat, this time starting to burn the material and drawing a bigger lungful of smoke (I discovered a few nights earlier that this method works just fine, and in fact seems almost nescessary to get all of the DMT out of the half-burnt weed). As I hold the smoke in, I can feel my mind start to expand beyond the boundaries of my skull. By the time I blew it out I was surrounded by movement and bright colors.\r\n\n\n\nObjects on my desk were squirming around as if I were peaking on a couple grams of really good shrooms. Except they were a bit livelier, brighter, and happier on DMT. Transparent neon colors, especially blue and yellow, forming vague and blurry geometric patterns were suspended in the air before my eyes. Every so often I would see a small glowing ball of light dash across my field of vision or a pair of weird eyeballs pop in and out of existence in some random location. I perceived these as entities, but that I had not smoked enough to really get a better look at these things.\r\n\n\n\nIt was also difficult not to notice the fact that I was extremely high. DMT feels similar to LSD, in the sense that the high is very much concentrated in your head. However, there is no 'body load' to speak of. DMT feels so natural on the body. There was definitely a buzzing sensation, a floaty, fluid feeling, and a sensation that my consciousness was extended across a larger space. It feels good, but I do not find there is a huge euphoric push or forced mood lift. Most positive feelings are a result of the experience itself, not a nescessary part of the drug's effects.\r\n\n\n\nSo I put on some music. I listened to Grateful Dead, some Phish, and other mostly-live hippie music over the course of the next hour or so. I found that the DMT, no doubt enhanced by the cannabis, made my music sound absolutely amazing, and made me feel like I was in the crowd, sitting outside on the grass on a sunny summer day, experiencing a concert live among a crowd of groovy people.\r\n\n\n\nI don't know why I decided to mess around in Photoshop at this time. But it was fun, and I enjoyed the visuals looking at the computer screen. I realized how strange and kind of lame it was to be on my computer during a DMT trip, and also realized I am pretty much tied to my computer for a lot of the time when I don't have anything else to do. But I continued to use the computer anyway.\r\n\n\n\nThe effects of the DMT were still going strong, and I thought I better smoke it soon if I want to get any higher on this stuff before I run out. DMT seemed to erase my concept of time. It seemed like I had 'done too much stuff' after smoking the first bowl of DMT to still be feeling it this strong. I found, looking at the clock, that my estimates of elapsed time were always much longer than reality. Also, I believe the cannabis extends the length of DMT's action. I ate 3mg of Melatonin, hoping it would kick in after the DMT had worn off, to help me sleep. Then I went to pack some fresh greens in my bowl with the second half of my DMT.\r\n\n\n\nOops! I'd forgotten I still hadn't finished the first bowl! I finished off the cannabis in a couple more hits, along with a very noticeable amount of DMT which raised me right back to the intensity of my first peak (which had died down a bit in the time it took me to arrive at this point). I chilled out for a couple minutes, noticing increased entity activity in the air around me. This was actually very distracting, because it seemed like they were fond of sneaking up on me.\r\n\n\n\nBut I didn't wait long to pack those fresh greens and put the remaining ~12mg of DMT on top of it. I took it all down in three or four big hits.\r\n\n\n\nBy the time I'd blown out the second to last hit, I noticed my bed was levitating. By the time I'd blown out my last hit, there was a river, formed of psychedelic patterns, flowing through my floor. The high was getting too intense for me to sit at my desk any longer so I quickly made a playlist on my computer that would last about 30 minutes, and then I made my way over to my bed to lie down.\r\n\n\n\nI experienced a sensation like my body was being gently, yet persistantly pulled up into space. I would have loved to have enjoyed this sensation and meditated in this state of being, but there were far too many distractions. The amount of activity in the air, consisting of flying glowing energy balls, fluid transparent amorphous shapes - one of which remained just over my right shoulder, and followed me into the bathroom as I stood above the toilet and did my business - let's see, what else? Oh yes, plenty of pairs of glowing eyes popping in and out of existence in random places. I wouldn't ever take DMT without expecting to see those... Well, in general there was just a whole lot of things flying through the air, usually at such a quick speed that I couldn't help but divert my attention towards it. That meant I spent a lot of time lying in my bed with my eyes fully open, darting around in partial amazement, partial intimidation at all these 'phenomena'.\r\n\n\n\nMy intimidation simply came from the fact that they always snuck up on me! Honestly, seeing a pair of glowing cat-like eyeballs pop out of something is more creepy than 'cool' for me. The zooming energy balls were allright, except that every once in a while one of them would flash very brightly and a couple of times that startled me. The fluid amorphous blobs were probably my favorite, although I didn't like how they (or maybe it was just one, I never saw more than one of these at once) liked to linger over my shoulder. Also I asked it not to follow me when I took a piss but it did anyway.\r\n\n\n\nSo, I spent what felt like a really long time lying in bed watching these entities. I couldn't really get much 'deep thinking' done, although I did have plenty of trippy streams of thought that I can't remember now. My tapestries were in a state of constant reconfiguration and movement. At one point my tapestry turned into the Grateful Dead dancing bears... except not exactly the same. Anyway, they were a weirder version of the dancing bears, but they were definitely dancing.\r\n\n\n\nAfter a while I noticed that the neon color patterns before my eyes had reappeared, and come back much more clearly defined. This time the pattern was unmistakeable. It was the chrysanthemum that I've read about many times in other DMT reports.\r\n\n\n\nI perceived this chrysanthemum as a dome, made of interlocking almost-triangles, which seemed to be suspended five to ten feet above and to the front of my head. I realized that this was only a cross-section of a tunnel-of-sorts, with one end coming out of my forehead, and the other end extending deep into space. I couldn't tell if it was a one-way or two-way connection. It seemed like my soul was a projection of my actual existence which was deep in space... so that I could make use of my human body, for whatever reason.\r\n\n\n\nDuring this time I was experiencing auditory hallucinations in the form of beeps, whirring sounds (made by the glowing balls of energy), and strange muffled spoken language. I thought this was fascinating, but it also made me feel a bit schizo.\r\n\n\n\nWell, the melatonin was starting to kick in, which seemed to be interacting with the remaining DMT, giving me a somewhat dissociated, sinking feeling which was neither enjoyable nor unenjoyable. The entities were still visible for quite a while, much longer than I expected any smoked DMT trip to last. I tried to close my eyes to see if sleep would be possible soon, and I saw a strange, mole-like beast crawling it's way towards me with pretty sharp claws. Maybe ten minutes after that I was able to close my eyes and see nothing other than a few colored blobs, and I was able to drift off to sleep very easily. I'd say I was still at a solid ++ from the DMT until about an hour after smoking it. And it's hard to limit a trip to a '++' rating when there are entities around.\r\n\n\n\n...\r\n\n\n\nI didn't get any extraordinary lessons out of this trip, just like all my other DMT experiences. I found all the entities I encountered basically useless and distracting. However I would try to be very careful setting expectations on any future experiments. I did find it somewhat recreational: music euphoria was great, visuals were beautiful, colors were bright and the buzz feels nice. On some levels it was very much like being dropped into the peak of an LSD trip. But I find it hard to relax around so much strange life. Perhaps if I got used to these entities, or they actually made meaningful contact with me it would be a different story.\r\n\n\n\nThe best part of the trip was the experience of viewing, and being attached to the chrysanthemum. I believe I gained some insights into the nature of our purpose as human beings, and this trip has only reaffirmed my belief that death is nothing to fear, and humanity is but a strange stop on our continuing journeys."

        "report_text": "Freebase DMT was not something I ever really imagined having a chance to taste, but as with so many of the most profound and important experiences in life, it more or less fell into my lap, and all I had to do, all I could do, was make the best use of it I could.\r\n\n\n\nSet and setting: alone in my condo on a Friday night. It had been a long time (relatively) since I had last used psychedelics. In the meantime I had been practicing meditation, strengthening and exploring my own mind and spirit, and making some important steps forward with my life. I felt confident and ready for anything.\r\n\n\n\nOn this evening I had decided to re-attempt, together, two well-regarded tryptamines I had tried before individually and had had disappointing experiences with, while still feeling there was potential in. To wit, I would be ingesting N,N-DPT and N,N-DMT, stacked on top of each other, potentiated with an MAOI and garnished liberally with nitrous oxide.\r\n\n\n\n(+0:00) - I predosed with 150mg of moclobemide.\r\n\n\n\nI did not plan to take either tryptamine orally, so this was largely a superfluous step, but I wanted to maximize the effect of both substances as much as possible, since standard doses had not worked for me in the past. NOTE that if either substance had been an amphetamine or phenethylamine, I would emphatically NOT have used an MAOI. But with tryptamines, as long as I am careful with dosage, I have never had ill effects with MAOIs, just stronger experiences.\r\n\n\n\n(+1:00) - I insufflated roughly half of a weighed dose of 110mg of DPT.\r\n\n\n\nI immediately followed the insufflation with a bulb of nitrous to help allay the burn and the bothersomeness of the drip. I also grabbed a bottle of lemon juice and periodically squirted a bit down my throat to counteract the drip as well. I find this works wonders against the alkaline burn.\r\n\n\n\nI sat down to watch television as I waited for the effects (getting satellite TV and a TiVo has unfortunately increased the quantity of my TV viewing I'm sad to say, but on the other hand, also the quality). In about 30 minutes I felt the warm body buzz of DPT creeping in. Mild flowing visuals also began to develop. Overall it was a +, maybe a ++ in terms of my ability to interact with reality, but it was such a relaxed, almost sleepy trip that it didn't feel like a ++. DPT for me has a very sedative effect, and I often feel myself staring into space and my eyes drifting closed when I take it. More like a trance than like sleeping, but still quite the opposite from the hyper-alertness of phenethylamine-based psychedelics.\r\n\n\n\nOver the next 30-40 minutes I inhaled about 20 bulbs of nitrous oxide. Rather than doing two in rapid succession, as I usually do if I'm trying to launch off into a ++++, I just kept up a steady pace of one bulb every few minutes. This eventually put me into a very relaxed, slightly drunken state of mind, which combined with the DPT meant that I was, well, pretty wasted. Psychedelic effects aside, I was probably as out of it as I would be from 3-4 drinks.\r\n\n\n\nBefore long I felt ready to attempt the DMT. As I indicated, my first two tries smoking ~50mg of DMT had been sore disappointments, resulting in a brief trance-like state with some nice visuals, but no more than a ++, which after all the hype surrounding this drug was really a bummer.\r\n\n\n\nI queued up my favorite tripping playlist on iTunes, which I have set to play wirelessly from my laptop through my central stereo system courtesy of Apple's Airport Express. I sat down in my favorite chair, and took several deep breaths to center my spirit.\r\n\n\n\n(+2:15) - I placed 80mg of DMT freebase in a pre-warmed lightbulb vaporizer, applied a butane torch, waited until I saw vapor, and inhaled three hits.\r\n\n\n\nAfter the third hit, I felt a heaviness rapidly building up in my limbs, in a portentious rush I was familiar with from 5-MeO-DMT. I quickly put out the torch and set it and the hot bulb down on a china plate on the floor, which I had placed there ahead of time to avoid setting fire to the rug. I sat back in the chair and, almost as an afterthought, exhaled a big cloud of smoke. That was the last action I took in this universe.\r\n\n\n\nBefore I talk about what happened next, a quick observation. The effects of a high dose of LSD (my favorite drug) are intensely memorable, gorgeous, soul-plumbing, something one wants to repeat again and again, partly because the experience is so beautiful and at the same time so chaotic and hard to piece back together. Like William James's description of the nitrous trip, 'As sobriety returns, the feeling of insight fades, and one is left staring vacantly at a few disjointed words and phrases, as one stares at a cadaverous-looking snowpeak from which sunset glow has just fled, or at a black cinder left by an extinguished brand.'\r\n\n\n\nDMT for me was not like this. Although the intensity of the memory faded somewhat in the days that followed, it seems to me that I can still remember almost every second of the trip, and it was full of intentional meaning, and anything but chaotic.\r\n\n\n\nBack to me in my chair surrounded by smoke. The song playing on the stereo at that moment was a reggae track called 'Free Up Black Man'. I am not a reggae fan and this selection was rather accidental; I had not thought to fast forward to one of my favorite songs in time for the DMT flash, and in hindsight that might have been an improvement. But I almost think it was better to be listening to the haunting, exotic melodies of the islands rather than something artificial, electronic and acid-like.\r\n\n\n\nAs I exhaled the smoke, I powerfully noticed the way in which the cone of smoke as it left my mouth lined up in perfect symmetry between the frames of two paintings hanging on the wall. Actually, symmetry was suddenly everywhere. Glancing down I saw the ornate patterns in the oriental rug organizing themselves, like nanobots, into bigger and bigger clusters of units. I closed my eyes for a brief second and behind my lids, this activity continued unabated -- the entire universe was organizing itself, falling into lines and regiments of ordered, colored blocks, all at the command, I sensed, of some master Entity. An all-powerful Him (yes, it was decidedly male. I don't consciously believe in a male divinity, but I can't deny that aspect of this experience).\r\n\n\n\nInside my head I could sense my synapses being corraled by the drug (inside me it was the drug, not 'Him' -- for the first few seconds I went back and forth between 'drug' and 'Him' as the giver of my experience), forced into lockstep with the higher order of the universe -- no longer free to be a messy bundle of neurons, they were lining up in perfect rows, marching along like soldiers.\r\n\n\n\nOpening my eyes again, I began to feel afraid, as I saw this process intensifying and accelerating far beyond my ability to keep up mentally. The details of my surroundings became increasingly hard to discern -- they kept organizing into each other and forming larger and larger aggregate clusters of shape and color. The world was going from full-color, live action detail to the level of detail from a scene in The Simpsons. I was physically frozen in place, unable to understand what was happening.\r\n\n\n\nSimultaneously: the amber LED display on my black stereo receiver, which sits atop my TV and happened to be in my direct line of sight during this open-eyed trance, became unreadable. Not blurry, no, if anything it became crystal clear, as if scales had fallen from my eyes. Rather, it was now in an alien language, a twisted hieroglyph of triangles and arcane script. This 'text' was flowing and changing and flipping, like the digits on a scoreboard, to reveal new text underneath.\r\n\n\n\nThis was all incredibly profound, and I felt intensely honored and privileged to experience it. And yet, it kept getting stronger and stronger. *I* was being erased by this sea of alien organization washing over the universe, and I would soon cease to exist as a separate entity. My first instinct was to fight against this, thrashing my head to the side, but I was commanded by Him to submit, and I could not refuse. He wanted me to keep looking, open myself, and to be part of Him, frozen in time and place for all eternity.\r\n\n\n\nI opened my eyes again and tried to calm myself and tell myself I would not die. Somewhere deep, deep in the back of my mind I knew I had taken a drug and this was not 'real', but this was so far from mattering that it really didn't count as 'knowledge'. But I told myself, 'As long as I can still hear the music, I'm still alive, I'm still in this world, time has not stopped, I am not frozen.' So I grasped desperately at the music like a drowning man with a life preserver.\r\n\n\n\n'Hey mon.... free up.... yeh mon....'\r\n\n\n\nThe singer sounded miles away, and was getting further away every second. And then his voice, the music, all the sound in my environment began cutting in and out like a bad cell phone connection, the gaps between sounds getting longer and longer.\r\n\n\n\n'Hey ..on .... ee up .... ey ... uh ... ... eh....'\r\n\n\n\nTotal silence. There was no sound, no sensory input of any kind from outside my body except a cartoon sketch of my living room, expunged of all detail, brightly lit by an otherworldly light, around which my eyes looked wildly. The last bits of language in my view, the digits on the stereo receiver, winked out one by one -- that is, the black box itself remained completely lucid and clear, someone had just erased all the text from it, one letter at a time, just as the sound was cutting out one syllable at a time, closing in on me in a narrowing spiral of deafness, muteness, and essentially blindness. Size and shape were still allowed to me to perceive visually, but language and detail were not. I was alone, with Him, in glassy frozen silence, for eternity. All I had to cling to was the defeaning sound of my own frantic breathing, a desperate sucking for life in a vaccuum, like the astronauts in their space suits in 2001: A Space Odyssey.\r\n\n\n\nAnd then. And then! The singer and his musicians began to break through the silence, singing to me from eons away: 'Free up! Stand up! Carry on! You got to staa-aaaa-aand!' Like grass and rocks emerging from beneath melting snow, the visual details of the room began to well up from behind the pristine surface of His frozen universe.\r\n\n\n\nHallelujah! The exhiliration of this moment was like nothing I have EVER experienced, on any drug, anywhere. It was to touch God. I had come through His realm and returned to my own, reborn, with more knowledge and wisdom than I had ever though I could contain.\r\n\n\n\nThe receiver on top of the TV came to life (not until later did I read about other people's DMT trips that have also contained 'mechanical elves', which this certainly was). It was an emissary from Him, and it tipped its hat to me and grinned, the way wacky cartoon cars grin, with their front grills as mouths. It jumped up and down on its little steel legs in time to the music, baring its teeth in a ferocious smile at me and nodding, 'Yes, Yes, This is real my friend, Oh yes, yes, This is REAL my friend, this is ACTUALLY HAPPENING, you have BEEN THERE, where so few others have been allowed to go, Can you believe it, man? Can you believe it? Ohhhh man. Now CELEBRATE boy!'\r\n\n\n\nI was back. I hugged myself, rocked back and forth, laughing. By now the visuals were truly insane, having completely broken out of their previously frozen hierarchy of organization. I was blinded by swirling masses of purple and yellow and chains of stars. By the clock, several minutes went by, and I must have essentially blacked out because I don't remember much of it. This part of the trip was indistinguishable to me from a hard acid trip -- just spacing out in a sea of visions and thought loops.\r\n\n\n\nAt one point I sat up in the chair and a SECOND flash hit me, a kind of aftershock that was a pale echo of the original flash. This one had much more of a noticeable body load, with hypertension, and for a second I was afraid, thinking 'I can't handle another trip right now, I'll have a heart attack', but I took a deep breath and it passed quickly enough.\r\n\n\n\n(+2:30 - 4:00) - I came down.\r\n\n\n\nThe rest of the evening was pretty scattered. I wandered around the apartment laughing and saying stupid stuff like 'Oh my god' and 'Damn!' and 'holy shit', and feeling incredibly grateful and excited to have made contact with the Higher Power behind DMT. Although I am not a religious person, I find it impossible not to have some tiny part of me say, 'You met God that night.'\r\n\n\n\nIt was pretty much impossible to tell when the DMT trailed off since the DPT was still in effect. At some point, after much back-and-forth, I decided to snort the remaining 50mg of DPT, and I finished off another box of nitrous bulbs, but this was pretty much a waste of material. Nothing else could be in the least memorable in the hours following the DMT voyage.\r\n\n\n\nAs an aside, when I thought about it later, I realized the visuals from DMT are extremely reminiscent of Incan and Mayan architecture, ziggurats, etc. The whole concept of reality 'organizing' into a geometrical regularity that ascends upward to God suddenly made a HUGE amount of sense to me after this experience. Of course, the huasca-drinkers who experienced this same effect centuries ago, and attributed it to God, had it replicated in their religious artifacts and architecture.\r\n\n\n\nIn terms of side effects, I did have a bit of a headache for a while, like I always get after smoking 5-MeO-DMT, and the DPT gave me some intestinal problems. Other than that this was a clean, clean trip.\r\n\n\n\nIn the days afterward, I felt like I had finally experienced what psychedelic trips are really all about. I was unsure how satisfied I would ever be again with 'average' trips. This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and if I happen to be so fortunate as to have a second chance to delve this deep into DMT, well, I will certainly not pass it up."

        "report_text": "Its been a few weeks now since my first encounter with DMT, something long awaited and highly anticipated, but which completely transcended any expectations I had of it.  I\u0092d read a lot of McKenna\u0092s rants about self-transforming machine elves, the Amazon shamans\u0092 helping spirits and ancestors, and friends had told me about gnomes in giant stack hats running around in a fully psychedelic playground. No matter how much I heard about the alien intelligence encounters, I kept putting them aside as interpretations that colour and play off each other; like one person says they encountered aliens, and so the next person interprets their own trip in a similar way, which creates a chain of influence over every next tripper.  However, I did expect something alien, something that I could recognise as alien, something sci-fi or fantastical, like a psychedelic Star Trek.  I couldn\u0092t have been further from the fact of the matter.\r\n\n\n\nI was at a friends house organising some other drug-related circumstances.  It came up that he had a bit of DMT left and asked me if I was interested in trying some.  --'Absolutely not'--  So we got in the car and drove to a place he recommended tripping at, up in the hills in a national park, a five minute walk through scrub into a secluded forest area. During the walk we talked about the feeling of the place, noting that there was a distinct pagan-ritual-site feel about the area, a kind of overarching, all-seeing watchful presence about the environment.  But it was peaceful, clear-skied, and fairly shady and cool.  In retrospect, I'm sure this comfortable place influenced the quality of the DMT flash.\r\n\n\n\nI had two attempts about 15 mins apart because the first was noticeably not a peak experience.  But it was a good introduction to the totally alien nature of the dmt visions.  Taking in the first toke, around 25mg, I began to notice weird body sensations, my trunk became slightly elongated, and everything was surging with an energy that was totally silent to the ears but like a raging river in my mind.  My heart felt like it was about to burst through my rib cage as I reached the peak of the inhalation.  I let out a single laugh as I began to exhale, partly because the sensations were awesome, not unlike the body rushes of mushrooms, but I was mostly just ecstatic that DMT molecules were finally having their way with my mind.\r\n\n\n\nI closed my eyes and was immediately face to face with a supreme being of sorts.  It had no face, and its form was like a string of multicoloured lights constantly morphing; like a clown making a series of balloon animals, beginning with a dog, he alters a couple of parts, holds it differently to reveal a dolphin, and so on.  It was certainly a living presence, and without a face it was still somehow staring eye to eye with me as though it knew everything about my entire life.  There was no sense of emotional attachment, but there was definite supra-linguistic communication happening.  This being and I were travelling at great speed through an infinite stretch of deep space \u0096 I was chasing it.  It stayed the same distance away from me the whole time and seemed to be at ease with the speed, while I was struggling to keep up.  It was as though it wanted me there, but not yet, not in this way.  It was telling me to come back when I could keep up with it, when I could catch up and pass straight through it.  Maybe this was the membrane that separates the being\u0092s world with mine, the chrysanthemum that McKenna described.  \r\n\n\n\nThe being zoomed away and the effects started to fade, leaving me in a blissful kind of luminescent state that surpassed any notion of Zen states or meditative bliss.  The real world had become indescribably fresh and crystal clear while I had my eyes closed.\r\n\n\n\nFifteen minutes later, and the second attempt was around twice the dose of the first, and began just the same, the visual environment became kind of fuzzy and my body seemed to spaghettify just slightly.  But within seconds of this there was a distinct difference.  I had only heard this described in other people\u0092s accounts once, I think, and I had totally forgotten about the possibility of it happening until it actually happened to me.\r\n\n\n\nJust after I released the toke, I looked around to see what was happening to my senses as I was coming up----when the entire universe began to buzz.  It was like a deep bass feedback loop that you sometimes hear in electronic music, like the humming noise of flying saucers in movies, very electronic and computer-like, but unbelievably real and right there \u0096 all around me.  I immediately thought that the DMT had unlocked a whole new realm of sound that we don\u0092t normally hear \u0096 a background kind of sound that would distract our ears from 'normal' functioning - the sound that matter makes.  I\u0092ve perceived the vibrations of matter and subatomic particles on other trips, mushrooms, acid, and once or twice even on the old hooch, but now with DMT it was a totally audible reality.  And more than just audible, this sharp bassy hum that was coming out of everything made everything vibrate, including myself and my sitter next to me.  It was so intense and pervasive that I had to close my eyes to escape the motion sickness of this vibrating mass of existence.  \r\n\n\n\nWhen I did, the buzz began to mutate and break up into all these telephonic/electronic modem-like noises, like a kaleidoscope of sound.  The sounds built and built, reaching a peak that culminated in a vortex which sucked everything in existence, the buzzing, the environment around me, and my entire being into a totally foreign dimension: and there I was with total silence.\r\n\n\n\nThe buzzing was gone, and I was in a room looking at a wall.  The wall was like a complex scaffold of constantly morphing angular prisms shimmering with colours that are completely beyond the descriptions of any language, and totally awe-inspiring.  I felt an uncontrollable smile grow across my face \u0096 reality-check \u0096 but I kept watching.  I immediately noticed that there was something more than just the wall.  I noticed at first there was something in the wall, popping out occasionally to show me it was there, it wanted me to recognise it before it would fully come out though. It was something like watching the flat surface of a calm beach and seeing a dolphin periodically break the surface for air.  When I recognised that there was definitely something living swimming through this scaffold of unbelievable shapes and colours, it came out.  It was a non-human female being flying around this hyper dimensional \u0091room\u0092.  She wore a flowing cape or gown that streamed directly off a big round glowing face, the kind of face that a 3-year-old kid draws \u0096 a circle with dots for eyes and a curved line for a mouth.  \r\n\n\n\nThat\u0092s all there was of her.  But her face was so alive, compassionate, and enlightened.  She was so happy when I realised she was there.  Then I watched as a pedestal literally grew out of the floor of this \u0091room\u0092, made of the same unearthly super-brilliant scaffolding.  My attention must have been distracted by this thing growing out of the ground because the female being got in my face and communicated to me (not in words) \u0093look at what\u0092s ON the pedestal!\u0094  I looked up and saw a diamond shaped object that was made of similar stuff to the walls \u0096 but infinitely more brilliant, more dazzling, more unspeakably awesome.  And as my smile grew and total awe and amazement filled me, this female being began flying around the object at great speed, keeping her eyes fixed on me.  She was doing flips and sharp turns and cheering as though she was celebrating the fact that she had the chance to show me.  She kept communicating to me, \u0093Look at it!  Look at it!  Isn\u0092t this awesome?!\u0094  This continued, and I kept my eyes on that unbelievable object as the scene began to fade.\r\n\n\n\nI became aware of my hands folded in my lap, slightly sweaty, my body was on an up and full of energy as my mind began to return to the reality of sitting in a forest setting next to the person who had just initiated me into yet another, but easily the most awesome, dimension of conscious reality.  I was left feeling unusually happy for at least a week after that experience.  It has also left me with a profound sense of fulfilment and far greater purpose and perspective in my life\u0092s quest to understand the nature of this human existence.\r\n\n\n\nFrom these experiences, I have to say DMT is quite patently the most accessible of the deep psychedelic states; and in terms of the practical, empirical analysis of one\u0092s own shamanic journeys, this is by far the \u0091easiest\u0092 landscape to traverse that I have encountered. Mushrooms require a huge amount of dedication and spiritual preparation (weeks and months for the most rewarding outcomes), massive amounts of attention, and a great deal of energy to keep myself at least partly detatched from the emotional roller coasters that the mushroom state can draw me into, particularly because of the extended time of the trips.  Same goes for powerful acid trips and other indole hallucinogens.\r\n\n\n\nI say this not because DMT is so short acting, but because on a proper dose of DMT, one\u0092s being is thrust into a peak experience \u0096 there is no choice in the matter.  On mushrooms or acid one must guide his or her own thoughts and emotions through precarious unknown landscapes, and even then a peak experience is not guaranteed.  DMT, however, seems to serve a peak experience on a platter with a salad on the side.  I knew from the moment I started toking, to when I found myself in another-dimensional-room, I KNEW this was RIGHT.  The DMT wanted me there, and took me there.  All I had to do was receive it graciously."

        "report_text": "I have always fancied myself a psychedelic adventurer, a believer in the mystical quality of the worlds surrounding us.  In the footsteps of Huxley, Leary, Metzner, Alpert, McKenna, Castaneda, and Strassman (to name a few of the pioneers) I walk with arms outstrecthed and wings unfurled, open to the multidude of experiences psychedelics have to offer.  My use of psychedelics has been solely for the purposes of spiritual enhancement and mental discovery.  I have tried almost all common substances with psychedelic properties and have read as much literature on the topic as possible.  My intent with any psychedelic journey is to make sense of a certain situation and/or a transformation amongst my mundane world. I have always found profundity, cosmological insight, and a sensibility that is derived from the intricate threads of wisdom woven within the tapestries of my body and the universe.\r\n\n\n\nThis account I am about to give is purely in the realm of the mytho-poetic.  And by this I mean as I write this I have only put together a few of the pieces that composed my DMT experience.  My ability to reflect upon and extricate meaning from the experience can only be implemented through a poetic description because the experience was, well, poetic.\r\n\n\n\nBefore I get to it I want to set the stage.  I have been planning this adventure for about a year now always cautious about where my mental/spiritual/corporeal state is.  I have had astrological advisors, polarity practitioners, cranio-sacral practitioners, and close friends alike talk with me about when and when not to take DMT.  I have friends who have had many experiences with DMT and those with none.  And I valued everyones' opinion especially those closest to me.  The only person however who knew when the best time to leap into the crack between worlds was me.  Needless to say, my mundane life had taken quite the dramatic turn of events and I had a dream that I took DMT and transformed into a Panther or some sort of large feline running through along a desert plateau.  I identify with the feline archetype and in Chinese astrology I was born during the year of the tiger.  Whern I have dreams such as this I interpret them as good omen and a time to take a psychedelic trip.  \r\n\n\n\nOne of my best friends who personally made a batch of DMT invited me to his and his girlfriend\u0092s home on the beach to take the DMT leap.  If there was anyone whom I could trust administering this drug to me it was him.  And the space that was offered to me was very warm and comfortable.  We waited until twilight, around 5:45 pm PST. We lit the room with candles, closed all curtains, and instilled the room with silence.  I could not hear anything but a distant roll of ocean waves that were nothing less than soothing.  As I do before any psychedelic journey, I practiced some very basic yoga stretches that I have learned from Bikram and Iyengar Yoga.  And after about 10 minutes of this I faced the north, west, south, and east and said a prayer for each direction: my safety, my ability to trust, my ability to find clarity, and for my capacity to retain wisdom and understanding.  \r\n\n\n\nThese prayers firmly established my intent for this experience and with humility and courage I sat down on the couch and let my friend administer the DMT, which he did with a glass pipe that had never been used. His girlfriend who is also a close friend of mine was in the room as well.  Both would sit with me and hold space and make sure I was safe.  The time was 6pm, twilight, the crack between the worlds as it were.\r\n\n\n\nThe first inhalation was deep and I could taste a burnt musky scent incomparable to anything I have ever tasted before.  I held in the smoke for nearly 15 seconds, exhaled and felt very light.  Upon the second inhalation I felt very dizzy and while I exhaled I fell back onto the couch lying horizontally.  My pulse rate shot way up and I was exttremely hot.  Immediately I heard a cracking in my ears followed by a loud ringing that only lasted about 10 seconds.  Silence.  My body trembled and I began breathing deeply and heavily letting out long sighs and moans.\r\n\n\n\nI visually witnessed the room disappearing like an evanescent footprint on the sand slowly being washed away by the tide.  Then there was total and immense darkness.  And as though I was propelled by some inexplicable force, my body was rocketed forward in a horizontal motion faster than anything I could comprehend. Swirls of light danced around me and I saw particles of matter all around exploding into multicolored fragments.  The terror I initally experienced was unfathomable.  I felt like I was dying and that I had no control whatsoever.  And at once, I surrendered to this death and in a sense celebrated it.  As soon as I did this I saw a strange multi-limbed entity approach me on my left, swooping in and craddling my body as though I was an infant.  It did not speak nor do I remember anything other than it had many arms.  It was very warm and non-threatening and it spoke to me with its touch and nothing more.  Its presence was extremely nurturing and it smiled with such seraphic peace and benediction.\r\n\n\n\nThe particles of light exploding around me, soft mercurial waves of color enveloping me and draping me with care, muslin arms holding me gently the universe expanding and contracting, angels dancing on effervescent stars, galaxies of light, sounds of butterfly wings burning, tendril tongues leaping like flames form a campfire, all derivations of geometrical patterns making reasonable the irrational.  \r\n\n\n\nDewdrops slipping off of buttercups, a warm desert breeze, a cactus field of great saguaros and ox tongues swaying gently as sheets of stars pass above, careening archetypes appearing and disappearing in front of me: a Pirandellonian clown, a giant black horse with a honey colored mane, an archer with an inviting grin, ferries with dragonfly wings, a wizard with soft spoken eyes, a lascivious young siren licking my chest with a long slippery buttermilk tongue, a bengalian tiger with piercing luminescent eyes, an old man laughing, a young girl crying, an Indian inside a pueblo praying over a dying boy menstruating through his nostrils, a aft man on rollerskates, and a crone in a purple shroud reaching her old withered hand to me\u0085the whole of humanity dancing naked amongst the gods and godessess of the storm.  These images passed by me so fast yet each intricate contour of their bodies I remember so clearly.  This lasted for what seemed hours and I calmly resigned to the incomprenibly beautifully changing aspect of the universe.  \r\n\n\n\nThe world runs by rhythms we can\u0092t possibly comprehend, and to make peace with that is the essence of being human.  This I felt like no other time in my life.  No other experience was remotely close to this.   And the whole time this presence or perhaps God, the Great Spirit was holding me in the warmest of embrace.  And slowly it brought me back to my corporeal existence in the room on the couch, so gracefully and elegantly.  My body felt like a lithe dandelion floating effortlessly back to the ground.  I began laughing joyfully at the unbelievable nature of my experience.  I felt like I now possessed an uncanny wisdom so powerful and so essential to my being that I retained a wondeful sense of self-confidence and peace. And as I opened my eyes I saw the room as it once was before.  There were strange geometrical patterns all around, yet I knew that I was back from wherever I went.  My friends were there, smiling.  I thought my god, how long were they there? How could they have waited with me so long, so reserved and peaceful?  Hours had passes, so I thought.  \r\n\n\n\nAnd to my amazment looking at the clock, only 6 minutes (earth time) had passed!  I meditated for about 10 minutes and then slowly got up and walked around.  My heart was still racing but within 10 more minutes I was calm and collected.  The only residual affect occurred about 8 hours later when I awoke with anxiety and in a pool of sweat.  I had shivers and chills and I immediately got in a warm bath and slowly regained my composure.  \r\n\n\n\nI watched the sunset that morning from my bedroom window and I felt a strong fire from within me that produced so much happiness and determination.  This fire from within I had never experienced and now that I have it, it carries me forth into the world with speed, agility, and a sense that the universe is indeed incomprehensible, and that no mathematical formula, no graph nor chart can possibly explain the infinitude and eternal changing manifestations of this endless flow of life.  And this flow of life is joyous."

        "report_text": "Several years ago, I experimented with DMT. I was introduced to this chemical through a friend of mine who was heavily into Shamanism. Over a 12 month period, I smoked it 4 times, with ever increasing doses. My friend recommended that I 'work my way up to the 'spirit' dose'. This was wise, because even in smaller doses, it can be a frightening experience. On my fifth 'journey', I found them - or more accurately, they found me.\r\n\n\n\nI've since read accounts from McKenna, and Strassman's subjects. I guess my experience was similar, though I didn't perceive myself as being inside a structure - rather, it seemed that the spirits were all around me. Wherever I looked, the swirling patterns transmogrified into these oscillating things which clearly acted independently of my own thoughts. At least that was the overwhelming perception I had. I can't really describe them - they were infinite in their complexity. I can see why people are convinced that they are entities separate from their own minds - its inconceivable that anyone can imagine such ... I don't what you'd call them or it.\r\n\n\n\nAnyway, I was there - wherever the hell it was - and all of a sudden each one of my fingers was connected to a spirit. Here's where it gets really strange - there were thousands of them near me now (and millions in the distance - though if I looked at the distant ones, they zoomed up close). So, next thing I know, each hand has thousands of fingers. I had complete control over each one! Like we can move our left index finger, I could control left finger 40,624. It was like I was a conductor - they were dancing and flying around in accordance with what I did with my 'super-hands'. Sound and sight seemed to merge and shift - I was conducting an orchestra of millions. \r\n\n\n\nThere was a lot of other stuff too, but I have never been able to recall it. My final memory is being in absolute nothingness, except for one spirit. As I looked at it, it started to oscillate so as I was looking at myself - or what I perceived was myself - I was changing form a thousand times a second. The oscillations became faster - and the spirit wanted to know who it was. It wasn't asked in words, but I knew what the question was - somehow. I said 'I don't know'. This 'conversation' went back and forth at an ever greater speed until, at the same time, we were both saying 'he is you is he is you....'. Then the words converged into 'hue' - literally it was blue. I mean, I became the colour blue. A psychedelic play on words! I was a frequency! Then this spirit rushed up to me from the other side of the galaxy, laughing. He had a present - like a normal box with a blue ribbon, and he said what's your favourite 'hue'? Next thing I knew I'd opened my eyes. The extra freaky element was that I had turned my head around and was looking straight out the window...at, you, guessed it, a big clear blue sky! \r\n\n\n\nOnce I had met them (or myself, perhaps - I certainly don't ascribe to the literal idea that DMT is conducive to contacting aliens), I decided not to do DMT again. I have experienced total and absolute fuck'n out there - and I'd be scared that if I did it again, that I wouldn't make it back. I don't think that there could be a more intense experience, however, I never imagined I'd experience what I did either. Its amazing - but a word of caution: it isn't a fun party drug. Some people want to go skydiving, and that's cool. But this was like being a super-ball bouncing around the universe. At the time, it really was too much!!!\r\n\n\n\nThe final freakiness? At certain times of the morning or afternoon, I look at the sky, and get this deja-vu feeling. Its just the right shade of blue!"

        "report_text": "We tested some of the DMT (Mimosa Hostilis Root Bark Extractions) and harmala with a group and have started to come to some conclusions about dose and timing.

        "report_text": "3/27/2003\r\n\n\n\nPsilocybin and DMT:  Interpretations of Your Mind\r\n\n\n\nLet me begin by briefly (or not so briefly) stating my history with drugs.\r\n\n\n\nAs I write this, I am 19 years old.  My first experience with any drug was with marijuana.  I had never even been drunk before my first time smoking herb.  I was a junior in high school, at the age of 17, and played drums in a local band.  Many of my friends smoked marijuana but had never asked me if I would like to join them and had never even smoked in my presence.  I suppose I must have exuded an air of disapproval even though I actually had no opinion on pot whatsoever.  My entire inspiration for trying the drug was the possibility that it may enhance or elicit some undiscovered, latent creativity within my brain.  Although I enjoyed the experience and have continued to smoke regularly since then, I did not find the substance to explicitly inspire me in any creative way (unlike DMT).  However, I believe my long-term marijuana use, (and all its implications which I will not list here), has changed my attitude towards life for the better.\r\n\n\n\nI am naturally skeptical about everything and so through my experience alone I formed the opinion that not all illegal drugs are bad (contrary to the message behind the US government's propaganda efforts).  After researching much about many different kinds of drugs, my friends and I became thoroughly interested in psychedelics in particular.  These drugs were not addictive, and for the most part, when used responsibly and in moderation, were physiologically harmless.  The mysteries presented and questions answered by them, the detailed reports of mystical and self-exploratory experiences people have had under their influence, the culture constructed around them, and the profound intellectualism exhibited by most serious members of its underground captivated me into exploring the psychedelic world firsthand.\r\n\n\n\nUp until the point that I smoked DMT, (last weekend as of this writing), I had had extensive experiences with psilocybin.  A recently acquired friend I had met on the campus of the university I attend informed me that many chocolates had been coming his way recently, and he wanted to know if I was interested.  The chocolates I speak of were chocolates containing crushed mushrooms with psilocybin content.  The exact classification of mushroom I am unaware of, although I was told each chocolate contained an eighth of an ounce of dried mushrooms, and after my experience with the chocolate in question I believe this information was correct as the experience I had was consistent with past trips that had verified psilocybin content.\r\n\n\n\nI had bought two chocolates, one was for myself and the other was a gift for my most trusted ally in psychonautical excursions, my brother.  As I would be home the next weekend from school, the plan was to eat them Saturday night, and preparations were underway.\r\n\n\n\nThe night finally came, and my curiosity as to whether the chocolates would actually work or not (you can never really know, although they did smell like mushrooms) was beginning to become overwhelming.  At the appointed hour, we each ate our chocolate and sat back waiting for the journey to begin.  Ten minutes later, however, I got a call from another friend within our circle who merely said, 'Hey, what do you think about visualizing geometry?'  At once I knew he spoke of the availability of a psychedelic drug, and before the trip kicked in, my brother and I hastily drove to his location, another good friend's house that we frequent on a regular basis.  The trip had not begun to take hold yet and the drive was literally about 2 or 3 minutes down the road so we knew we'd be ok.\r\n\n\n\nUpon our arrival, we learned that DMT was on the way to our location via another good friend who had randomly procured around 2 grams.  How exciting it was to hear that such an exotic psychedelic had fortuitously fallen into our laps!  The friend who had contacted me had already put in an order for us because he knew that we would definitely want to augment our currently developing experience.  I had wanted to try DMT since I had first read about its ability to produce powerful visions and an intense psychedelic experience.  I honestly never thought, however, that I would ever have the chance to try it unless I journeyed to South America myself and trekked into the Amazon, begging any shaman I saw for a taste of his precious brew.  Luckily this was not necessary though, and I acquired 50 milligrams for a mere and well-spent 15 bucks.\r\n\n\n\nThe DMT was a tiny pile of crystals that had a yellowish tinge to them.  They were crushed, but not to the degree that would form powder.  It would not be difficult and wouldn't take much time though at this stage, I surmised, to crush it down to a finer consistency that might enable the user to snort the drug (One of us actually did do this, although the intent was to make the drug even more smokable than it already was.  Whether or not this was beneficial or not is subject to debate).  Our plan was to smoke it, however, and I was satisfied with that, being a familiar ritual, and merely noted this observation to myself.\r\n\n\n\nThe DMT itself did not look like much.  However, I knew that it did not take much to produce extremely powerful effects, as this chemical is quite potent.  Introduce just 50 milligrams to your brain like I did, and I guarantee you may not be able to even finish the bowl, because it is likely that you may not be able to take another hit after the initial stages of the DMT experience incapacitate you.\r\n\n\n\nThe friend who had brought us the precious mind-candy told me that the best way to smoke it was to use a glass pipe and to smoke just enough herb to produce a bit of ash for the DMT to rest on inside the bowl.  Then it was a simple matter of CAREFULLY transferring the crystals to the bowl and finally commencing the smoking.  As I raised the pipe to my mouth, I was unaware of the profound and bizarre world that was about to envelop me?\r\n\n\n\n\tI inhaled with true determination, trying to be as efficient as possible in imbibing the precious smoke.  Its taste was nothing like the taste of herb; it was a little harsh (though nothing overwhelming for a chronic smoker) due to the plastic, synthetic nature of the smoke.  The taste was not all that unpleasant, but not very enjoyable when contrasted with the familiar taste of good cannabis.  I inhaled as much as possible, and held it in for around 10 seconds when, at that time, an immensely different mode of consciousness fully and completely enveloped me in such an acute and abrupt manner that it was as if I had been launched at light speed into an altogether alien dimension, complete with utter time distortion and, around 20 to 30 seconds later, incredibly ornate and detailed full-blown hallucinations.  The visual world that engulfed me consisted of nothing less than the most beautiful sights I had ever seen. It was a wholly awesome world that was bizarre, beautiful, captivating, and infinitely intricate.  The unifying characteristic behind all of the hallucinations seems to have been that they were all sharp, angular, geometric forms that stood in stark contrast to the organic and dream-like visions of a mushroom experience.  Nothing within my visual field remained unchanged.  The experience was not dreamy or slow, although significant time dilation did occur.  Instead, the lucidity of the trip was altered in such a way that the consistency and flow of normal consciousness was completely transformed beyond recognition.  I remember thinking at once that I would never be able to comprehend this experience completely after its effects had fully diminished.\r\n\n\n\nThe mushroom trip that had been gaining momentum was completely drowned out by that of the DMT.  I had been experiencing that familiar old feeling that is characteristic of the initial stages of the mushroom trip immediately before smoking the DMT.  This powerful mushroom feeling that I was so accustomed to was replaced by a new and infinitely more intense sensation within 10 or 15 seconds of smoking the first hit of DMT.  The DMT consciousness is so dramatically different than that of any I had ever experienced, that it is difficult for me to elaborate on it in the manner that I would like to.  If the mushrooms were still affecting me, I wouldn't have known it, probably thinking that the combined effect of the two was the total effect of DMT because I recognized no mushroom-like feelings until the DMT effects began to weaken.  Whether or not the mushrooms potentiated my hallucinations I cannot say; because DMT visuals are widely regarded to be very intense, it is difficult to rate the intensity of my own visuals relative to those I have read or heard about that were unaffected by psilocybin.  Also, this was the only time I had ever smoked DMT as of this writing, and so I am unable to compare this experience with an unadulterated DMT trip.  What I can say, though, is that the visuals were unique to DMT because my mushroom visuals have never been of the same bizarre, alien, and geometric, angular nature.\r\n\n\n\nThe very first visual distortion I noticed was the smoke I exhaled from taking the first hit.  It became cartoonish in nature, and lacked fine texture as the rush blurred my vision momentarily.  Although the visuals had not hit me until now, at this point I was already mentally in the midst of a different universe.  As I exhaled my cognitive self twisted and contorted so violently that it dissolved completely, and my body was no longer my own.  My legs were not connected to me, nor were my arms or torso.  In fact, I wasn't even sure where 'I' was in relation to the rest of my body.  To try to understand this, imagine disjointed fragments of your bodily perception suspended in some unknown and uncharted dimension of reality.  \r\n\n\n\nBecause my consciousness was so drastically altered at that point, I was at once confronted by a stunning realization that my ability to monitor my social functions such as body language or conversation was severely compromised.  So I tried my best to remain stationary, act normal, and merely take in all the sights and sounds.  \r\n\n\n\nAs the world came back into focus, it was as if I was within a Picasso painting.    The wall directly across from me, being a two dimensional image on the page of a book, for instance, in a sober state of mind, immediately leaped out of the page into three dimensional existence.  The wall gained depth by promptly becoming many walls, at least three, each having a slightly different distance from me, but all in the same position at the same time.  What was even more startling about the wall, however, were the patterns that erupted within it.  Thousands of uniform abstract shapes with sharp, elongated tentacles of sorts wove in and out and between each other in a fluid motion and with an almost rhythmic consistency.  They all had a shade of wood grain from the influence of the wall?s color, however this was translated to the DMT world as a bright golden hue which, when perceived along with the previously described components of this hallucination, made the spectacle of a wall simply awe-inspiring to behold. \r\n\n\n\nThe next thing to mesmerize me was the very table that sat in front of me where the portions of DMT had been delegated to the respective parties and preparations had been made.  The surface of the table assumed a vastly different form of hallucination, though it was still characteristic of the components comprising the world in which I was situated.  As soon as I turned my gaze toward it, the table's surface picked up and compartmentalized into planar segments, each encompassing latticed 'highways' of flowing colors.  It was like a bizarre pool of christmas lights, a dazzling, free flowing network of brightly colored gems.  For some reason, I can remember noting to myself that after seeing this, I could somehow understand the motivation behind some of the visual themes in Mexican and Native American art better.\r\n\n\n\nAt this point, the earlier sensation of social apprehension mostly ceased to exist, (though I believe some of it stubbornly still remained).  Because I was so enamored and absorbed into the world created by my own mind, it was as if all experience had become subjective to my brain, and thus when I later reflected on my sober experiences in life, I felt that I had perhaps gained further objectivity in their day to day scrutinization.  This was an important aspect of the DMT experience for me, besides the obvious implications of creative inspiration.  I realized that the world immediately constructed around me was not the result of some gateway into a hyper-realm that resided in a dimension of some higher order relative to own existence, as some psychedelically inclined authors have theorized in their eccentric explications of these experiences.  Instead, I understood that this very world that surrounded me only existed within my own brain.  The enormous differences between it and my normal perception of the world were brought about by none other than a massive widening of the creative floodgates within my mind, and the waters that had flowed forth had done so with such force, that my entire consciousness was enveloped entirely.  I was immersed in the normally latent artistic ideals that had always resided in my mind.\r\n\n\n\nI had already reached my peak, and was on my way down.  At this point, I had the urge to explore a little outside before the DMT experience had ended.  As I rose up, I surveyed the environment around me, and in visually assessing the whole inside of the barn at once I was amazed at the distinct, unifying character of the hallucinations that comprised my surroundings.  Everything adhered to a central theme, what I perceive as the ultimate realization of artistic ideals that I mentally harbored.  Now, this may contradict notions described earlier of the differences between the experiences of different psychedelics such as the 'dreaminess' of mushrooms and the 'sharpness' of acid trips.  I do not believe these sort of characteristics of hallucinations are indicative of one's personal artistic ideals, as they evidently vary according to substance ingested.  Rather, the specifics of one's artistic ideals can perhaps better be understood by an examination of one's psychedelic experiences that synthesizes the visual products of the various influences of different drugs.  A psilocybin mushroom may present visual manifestations of your artistic ideals in a seemingly more 'earthy', spiritual, or organic matter, while acid/DMT may help you see these ideals through forms that are mentally influenced by your more critical, mathematical/logical tendencies.\r\n\n\n\nAs I walked out of the barn, I followed my friend who had ordered the DMT, the third explorer of the mind besides my brother and I.  He briefly turned to me with a big smile on his face and I noticed that in each eye he had two intersecting pupils, like two new moons, one partially overlapping the other forming a seamless black shape.  My brother, interestingly enough, described witnessing the same phenomena.\r\n\n\n\nI looked into the sky and the stars were surrounded by a lens flare-like quality that was, of course, composed of a multitude of different bright colors.  The quality I speak of, however, was perceived as if I had been looking through water, as if the lens I looked through was submerged, even though I was fairly positive no tears were in my eyes.  When I look down upon the ground I saw the crabgrass around me as a vast jungle of sprouting clay figures.  They formed a dense, fecund little garden, and, as odd as it seemed, I couldn't help but to think to myself how they seemed so edible - it was as if they were some sort of food, like I could take a big bite right out of one.\r\n\n\n\nThis is when the mushroom feeling began to come back to me and I could feel the DMT fading.  But the mushrooms were nowhere near to fading, they came on strong and familiar old hallucinations took the places of the alien world I had briefly explored.  The rest of the trip was spent mostly on talking with my brother about the implications of the DMT experience and how amazing it had been.\r\n\n\n\nIf you are an interested individual, with the psychological fortitude and confidence necessary, I highly encourage you to take any rare opportunity you may have to try this chemical!  I would, however, like to emphasize the prerequisite of psychological fortitude, simply because of how quickly one is overcome by this drug.  Literally, the trip reaches full peak in under 45 seconds!  This can be potentially frightening for some individuals, but as long as you understand the basis of these feelings, and their inherent irrationality, one is able to successfully ignore them, vanquish them, and enjoy the trip.  If it has not been made evident by this telling, I would most definitely try this drug again!  Lots of fun, and no 'hangover'.  It only lasts less than 10 minutes, unless potentiated by MAO inhibitors (do not take this for advice, I am no pharmaceutical expert/chemist!  This information should probably be verified before being tested firsthand).  \r\n\n\n\nIn light of all of this, one must remember to either have fun or learn something (or both!), and above all else, be SAFE when exploring your mind."

        "report_text": "I first tried this years ago, and misfired because the smoke was too harsh. The following is a very ineadequate accounting of my second attempt--and first experience--with DMT. \r\n\n\n\nI had done a great deal of LSD and mushrooms, and considered myself experienced in terms of psychedelia. Having taken over ten grams of mushrooms more than once I felt that I could always remind myself that I, as the observer, had made a choice. \r\n\nThis is ridiculous. \r\n\n\n\nMy partner, and so called trip guide, was an intelligent man in his fifties (I was thirty), and had also introduced me to peyote. We had agreed that the experience would occur at his place, and all of the usual pre-trip steps were taken...i.e., the fasting, the meditation, and so on. \r\n\n\n\nAt this point I must interject that my meditations were, up to the experience, a facade, although I was not yet aware of this fact. I simply thought about myself. Real hard. Even some of the more difficult mushroom experiences that I had undergone up until then had not purged me of my buried feelings of inadequacy, and this is important to mention here, because I did not understand something very VERY crucial, and that is that I was not trying DMT to learn, but rather, to PROVE something to myself. This is very unwise. \r\n\n\n\nThe crystals were smoked from a pipe, and among a few tobacco grounds. I was able to draw a good amount from the end of the pipe, and yet again, and I tried to hold the smoke but again, I could not. I exhaled, halfway expecting that I would get the so-called 'museum dose' of the compound. \r\n\n\n\nI have read much literature about DMT. I cannot say that anything has come close to adequately describing even the most miniscule element of the experience. I did not notice anything at all in terms of distortions before my mind went. \r\n\n\n\nThe feeling is very difficult to relate with words. Imagine understanding your own mind to be a map, a very small representation of a very large idea, and suddenly discovering that it was, in fact, foldable, and that it had been folded for all time. \r\n\n\n\nI sensed my mind was flat, and very inadequate, and that I had been folded up and put away, so to speak, centuries ago, forever ago, because I was discarded. I was effluent. I was a remnant of a grand theme, once possible, but now ruined and shattered, and as a conscious entity I could not be destroyed, but only amused. The amusement ended when the occlusion to its purpose ended, and I became aware of my SOLITUDE. This was immediate and powerful. \r\n\n\n\nI cannot recall the transition to the void, there were no colors, or visions in the traditional sense. I realized immediately that I had actually poisoned myself, and this was not a DMT trip at all, this was death. \r\n\n\n\nThis period of time is impossible to relate. Try to understand that there was no sensation of time at all. Nothing was linear, and my ideas seemed to come to me at impossible intervals. My brain had been killed, I could tell, because I could not think. I could only sense the overwhelming loneliness and shame. I had actually believed at some point, somewhere, that I was alive, but this was not possible, because I was a scrap of discarded thought, not worthy of keeping. It was a foregone conclusion that I would destroy myself. \r\n\n\n\nThis seemed to be forever. \r\n\n\n\nThere appeared in the vastness a tiny point of light. I remember realizing that I had not died at all, but that I had been dead. Then, not dead, but dormant. DORMANT. I was about to be born. \r\n\n\n\nThe feeling of flying is not an accurate description of the sensation that accompanied my movement toward the point, which was gold, and, to my surprise, was actually metallic. I came immediately upon the source, which was a DNA scarab, a construct, an insect of impossible dimensions, miles in diameter and circumference. \r\n\n\n\nThe skin of the carapace was polished to a high sheen and thin to the point of transparency. I could see tiny, endless arrangements of gears and pinions just beneath the gold wing, tiny points of alien light darted from what were molecular points of cognitive energy, impossible in color and detail, billions and billions of precision gears meshing quietly and generating consciousness, which was traversing a planned route, terrifying in its complexity, but beautiful in its exactitude. \r\n\n\n\nI followed a point, there was warmth, to the top of the scarab's enormous body. It had a tiny human head, the size of a marble, attached via a series of DNA strands that had been transformed into a clear metal. The head was unaware of my presence and it had a small mouth, which opened to speak. \r\n\n\n\nFrom the mouth came forth the matured beam of thought, which had started from a cog (Cognitive) in the belly of the insect, years ago, and had grown as it rose to the head, morphing into a form of concentrated phosphene light. the beam poured from the tiny mouth, and became stacatto at once, and conical, in sections that grew, as ideas, and hypnotized me into allowing myself to be enveloped by a punctuated green, now a geometry of raw cognition without ego, and with a destination. \r\n\n\n\nI rode in the singular idea, aware of its purity and clarity, and above all, its sense of purpose, as it was not aware of my presence, and fell to a violet montage of heads which were dislocated and ethereal, but awaiting its arrival. \r\n\n\n\nI was, suddenly, inside of a brain. I became instantly aware of the physicality of the idea, which was A NOTE OF MUSIC. \r\n\n\n\nIt was then revealed to me on a large screen, attached to a gleaming wall, that the brain was the brain of Bach, and the idea was one in a stream of many, and fell to his shaking hand in a dimly lit room, flickering with candlelight and heavy curtains, to the end of the point of his pen, where it was transcribed, in ink, and solidified forever. \r\n\n\n\nThis, I realized, happened concurrently with the HEARING of that exact note, in that exact piece of music, namely, the second of Six Motets, and that I had, in some elusive past, cued that CD to play while I tripped, and I was now revisiting that precise moment, which occured exactly then, and only then, and required of the universe the creation of cognition and the receiving thereof, just to hear the one note, exactly there, in exactly that fashion. \r\n\n\n\nI watched the transcription through a telescope from a starship, and realized that it was diminished only by my yearning to beccome a stenographer of music (I am a musician). My own music seemed like noise. \r\n\n\n\nI saw the fatigue in the wrinkled forhead of the great master, Johann Sebastian Bach, as he received the beams of knowledge, and his music was living. \r\n\n\n\nFrom there I was told by a small man sitting in a plant that I was mediocre, and that in and of itself, my mediocrity had a function, which was to define what is great, and what is not, because how can the great be great if it is commonplace? \r\n\n\n\nI, in my mediocrity, was a necessary element of greatness, then, and this eased my spirit. \r\n\n\n\nI found myself at that point laying on a couch, and had a fleeting sensation of having taken a drug, and I realized that my heart was not beating, and that I was trying to enter my own body. I saw clearly the fear in my own eyes, and was saddened by my weakness. \r\n\n\n\nI became preoccupied with my lying. Everything I was, was lies. I was a liar. Even lying down, I was lying, always lying. My existence was a tangled cluster of lies, cancelling themselves out, struggling to make sense, surviving only on the energy that others gave when they turned to see the freak who could not tell the truth. And so I had lied to myself about DMT, and it was not a hallucinogen, it was a poison, used by all liars, to destroy themselves. I watched lies come out of my mouth. They were giant, glistening centipedes, hideously related in a mutant way to the glorious insects of cognition, but bastardized and diminished. I saw broken gears in their grotesque bodies, and they came from my own mouth while I lay there, motionless. \r\n\n\n\nI then realized that they were being driven from me. I was undergoing a type of exorcism, and I was immediately aware of a ram on a hill of purple grasses, beyond a rushing stream of beautiful microscopic geometries. The ram had eyes all over its head, and beside was a horse that was ten feet tall at the shoulder, and breathing heavily. The horse watched, and then ran towards a greying horizon, while overhead a silver sun was spinning sounlessly. \r\n\n\n\nThe ram had driven the lies from me, and I approached the stream. There were machines in the stream, and I was told not to touch the water, but to find the crossing, and I realized that the cross of Christ was not a cross, but a crossing, from judgement into salvation, and that the stories of religion were allegories, froming themselves again and again until they could be superimposed over the framework of machinery that was my own personal syntax. \r\n\n\n\nI realized the glory, the importance, of TRUTH. \r\n\nThe truth was that my fear ruled my existence. \r\n\n\n\nCould salvation be truth? \r\n\n\n\nI was guided to my soft, pink brain by a dragonfly, which was piloted by a man with no eyes. \r\n\n\n\nIt is impossible to adequately relate to those reading this that all of the above was occurring simultaneously, and yet, in right angles, and even moreover, in a corner of what I was to discover was a pile of powder on a floor, into which my eyeballs fell, and the dust did adhere. \r\n\n\n\nI got up, yet I did not move. \r\n\n\n\nMy arm was hanging of the side of the couch, I remember, and there was my friend, watching a ball of regurgitated and spoiled silliness (television?), and he was unaware of my fear and astonishment, but turned his head to look at me.\r\n\n\n\nHis head was flat, and it scrolled as it turned, because there was no depth, and he himself was devoid of depth, and there was a pool of idea between I an he, and in the pool, an unfathomable depth, and in that depth, a monster. \r\n\n\n\nHow do I tell someone, anyone, that nothing so far related amounts to even one iota of the simultaneous aspect of dimensional revelation, and the absence of spacetime, and the simplicity of observation in the only-then-and-thereness of that particular embodiment of who I was and who I have become? \r\n\n\n\nThe experience cannot be shared, and as I read over what I have typed, I understand that I have only served to diminish the experience, and turn it into an absurdly inadequate written version of a cinematic version of a non-cinematic event. \r\n\nWhat do I say from here? \r\n\n\n\nWriting this seems like a wisp of a tentacle that remains, and seems like punishment, because it involves the re-integration of an ego so shattered, and yet necessary for day to day function, and I am acutely aware of my lies, insofar as I cannot tell what happened to any audience, no matter how hard I try. \r\n\n\n\nThere was, in the 'comedown', a moment of such beauty, when I became aware of the Motets, playing, still playing, perfectly and crisply, while I lay on the couch, being born. \r\n\n\n\nA lot of people talk about the tragedy of one's life if their most profound experiences were those occurring under the influence of a drug. \r\n\nThose people are unwatered seeds. \r\n\n\n\nI have done DMT two other times. Each was more fantastic than the preceding. Indescribable, every second. I find that a part of me is convinced that this drug, this molecule, is of itself, alive, and was once married to us, and has since been divorced, and we are therefore in a state of bereavement and mourning. \r\n\n\n\nAnd then I realize that we are longing, as humans, for contact, any contact, with ourselves and those whom we love, and that contact is so elusive, and seemingly inadequate, and yet, even every touch and word from another is a precious singularity, never to be repeated, but only diminished by retelling, and remembering, and finally, fading away. \r\n\n\n\nI cannot communicate how my DMT experience altered everything forever. It was after this experience that I stopped all cocaine and crack, for good, never to visit them again. They are my enemy. I was taught this on, and by, DMT. \r\n\n\n\nFor those of you who are considering trying DMT, I would say, do not consider this to be even a shred of what to expect, there is NOTHING that can prepare you, there is no comparison to LSD, and while there may be some allegorical connection to the mushroom, the mushroom is like a movie of the actual life of DMT. \r\n\n\n\nAnyway, I have talked incessantly to many people about the experiences I have had, and I wanted to share these aspects of this infinity here, if for no other reason, just to stimulate thought and curiosity. \r\n\n\n\nDMT is bigger than me."

        "report_text": "The fumes intertwined, the deep red speckles weaving within the smooth green vapours as they fell into my lungs, my brain already throbbing from total sensory overload. My focus faded and separated into two entirely different scenes, as if looking through a red green set of 3D glasses. The blurs began to take form, and out of the mist, stood Dimitri and Sally : the blackness unfolding behind them.\r\n\n\n\n'You have just done what no other man has done before : attempted to control the two herbal super powers of Mother Earth,' they said in unison, 'and by now must realize just how dangerous your trip will be'.\r\n\n\n\n'My trip ? Where am I going ?'\r\n\n\n\n'Not even the most experienced psychonauts know exactly where their adventure may lead them, and but a few return alive. The lands you will encounter are ones of purity and the utmost secrecy, for they exist only within you : what ever shape that manages to take form behind us shall be your path. Take care in where you place your next foot, for this world is one of surprises, some of which are hardly as they seem.'\r\n\n\n\nWith that the two apparitions vanished, and I stared into the darkness in front of me. A white cannon light streamed across the night sky to my right, and a pack of rainbow butterflies followed the stream of photons with unimagined speed. A whoosh of white doves whistled over my head, bowing down over the streets before sailing behind a grey skyscraper.\r\n\n\n\nI was in a bustling city of buildings, cars and streets - with the amount of activity ecstatic. People were all flocking towards the hill where the birds went and the lights were coming from, all content to smile and wave at each other, all perfectly happy with the chill in the air and the stranger blocking the foot path.\r\n\n\n\nI stepped out of the road to let the people by, with a few encouraging pats on the back to help me get to where I was heading. I had just made it to the shops on the edge of the footpath when I bumped into the action hero himself, James Bond. A purple suit and an off yellow Rolex on his wrist, his perfect voice sang out in a goodbye to the shop owner behind him - a Calvin Klein store, where he must have purchased such a fine suit.\r\n\n\n\nEven by the lustre of the night sky the shop looked vibrant : its pink walls coated in brown specks of a crumbly material, soft on the eye but hard to the touch. I swivelled the rock in my hand, admiring its sensation of power and significance before the bell of the shop next door rang, and out stepped one of the weiredest dressed women I\u0092d ever seen. She was coated from head to toe in every coloured garment in the land, beaming with a grin that melted my heart right there. Both of our eyes met, and she walked up to me, talking all the way :\r\n\n\n\n'Hello ! How are you ! Don\u0092t you just love my clothes ? Where are you heading tonight ? To the night club, no doubt ! Silly me ! Enjoying your trip in Phenethylaminia I imagine ! Won\u0092t you be my guest at the bar tonight, young man ? Which raises the question, have we been properly introduced yet ? There I go again, yacking my mouth off to strangers again ! Aren\u0092t I just a doof !'\r\n\n\n\nI was swept off my feet and into her grey Audi TT parked outside, and only managed to catch the name 'Visionary Cacti Phenethylaminia' on her shop front before wizzing off the street towards the hill.\r\n\n\n\nEvery exotic car brand imaginable was displayed for all those eyes quick enough to catch them zoom past, but our Audi had just enough zip to even their speed : Blue Armani\u0092s, Red Ferrari\u0092s, Green Mitsubishi\u0092s, White Rolls Royce\u0092s ...\r\n\n\n\nThe towering cylindrical buildings flew by, and I was inspired to question the lady as to it\u0092s odd texture - it seemed it was the pride of the land, and that I may come across the material tonight without much trouble. I glanced up at the hill, and we cruised higher towards the light and sounds : by now, the whole land was thumping with a beat resonating from the night club above us. I soon discovered my exubrant host was Ms. Kelly, and that I would be meeting Adam at the club tonight, the mayor of the city we were now leaving behind us. I was the first 'white eye' this land had ever had, and I must meet the mayor 'before I lose my sense of individuality' ... whatever that meant.\r\n\n\n\nThe doors almost fell off their hinges due to the overpowering thump of a thousand speakers, each almost as tall as myself. It seemed a Guest DJ had been hired in advance to accommodate the crowd gathering at the entrance : bodyguards were non existent in this society, and all those who were ready to enter passed straight along the empty line and into the blinding light that flowed from the doorway. 'Torsten Weirdman' read the flyer stuck to the door, but his talent was far from it.\r\n\n\n\nThe rest of the night was a blur from then on, and I can only remember the trance like state I entered as I connected with the group around me : we all formed a whole on the dance floor, and it left me deep in thought as to how much Earth would benefit from these mysterious glowing pills that were being handed around.\r\n\n\n\nFinally, after a long night of rapid pulse beats and frequent menthol breaks, I was approached by Ms. Kelly once again and led up to the main podium, and was stood beside Torsten and the empty space that was soon to be filled. Ms. Kelly hushed the attentive group as Adam stepped up to microphone, cleared his throat, and began to speak :\r\n\n\n\n'Hello, and welcome again to this most special of nights, one which I have a few highly regarded guests in attendance. Thanks to Ms. Kelly, we have arranged for Phenethylaminia\u0092s proudest export, Torsten Weirdman, to play live for us all. But the real reason for such a gathering is so that I can announce the arrival of the lands most miniscule pupilled guest, the honourary ...'\r\n\n\n\nAdam froze. His face went white with horror, before falling face first through the podium and into the crowd below. Blood sprayed out the gap in the back of his head as the knife wriggled free, and its owner recolied its blade to his lips. His naked body was translucent and slimy, and his spindly figure was poised ready to attack again. Our eyes met, and I could see his flaring up, his deep and wretched soul in an agry fear at my innocence and individuality.\r\n\n\n\nThe room became a blur as Ms. Kelly forced myself into the throng of silence below, screaming out : 'Katey ! Take the boy to Lucy ! And have him perform the candy flip !'\r\n\n\n\nI heard Ms. Kelly\u0092s blood curdling scream as I landed flat on my back on the hard cork board floor below, my back aching with blunt pain from the landing. I was blacking out fast, and was suddenly swept up and was somehow flying towards the roof above me. I caught sight of the evil monster as he withdrew his knife from Torsten\u0092s throat, eyeing me on as if to judge my inner being.\r\n\n\n\nWith that, I was sent crashing through the ceiling, rocketing out of view, away from the glowing lights filtering out of the gap in the roof.\r\n\n\n\nI came to as the bottles of fire sprayed past us, streams of flaming liquid pursuing our every twist and turn. Molotov cocktails were rising from every angle from the misty land below, the scorch of flames burning the air beside our heads. The fog was torching in places, its flames sizzling before being enveloped by the air above it. The area smelt of petrol fumes, and was generally creepy. Audible yells and shallow splashes could be heard below.\r\n\n\n\n'Where are we Katey ?'\r\n\n\n\n'Keep quiet for now ! I will tell you later ! Let me dodge these molotov\u0092s for now !'\r\n\n\n\nAfter a few minutes the mist cleared, and the banks of a vast sea rose up to meet a land of sunny fields, winding creeks and vast forests that encompassed all of natures beauty. We slowly descended into a ring of stones beside a creek that ran deep into the land, and landed comfortably, although weary from our journey.\r\n\n\n\nAs I spun around to see who had taken me all this way, I saw the sun rising gently behind this mammoth figure of plastic piping and metallic armor. Katey was a woman warrior with serious technological know how, a jet pack flaring at her back and her suit flashing with read outs and beeping micro chips. She glistened in the sun, and I could not speak - but she went first :\r\n\n\n\n'I can imagine you have a lot of questions that are begging to be answered, but I can\u0092t stay here and idly chat - I shall get started straight away. You may be wondering who - or what - that thing was back in the night club. That monster is Chris, Adam\u0092s brother. His jealousy of Adam\u0092s lucrative control of the night club market has long been his uphill struggle, and cannot stand being swept aside for Adam\u0092s popularity and respect. His rage has finally driven him to commit murder upon his own brother, as well as Ms. Kelly and Torsten Weirdman. His attack is not entirely coincidental though : he obviously picked the same night that you, the white eye, decided to attend the festivities. We had to keep you as far away from Chris as possible, for you are now the only person alive who can face up to him : Adam could, but he could not guard his back forever.'\r\n\n\n\n'How did you know I was coming ?' I said, full of fear of this strange and evil presence in the land I just left behind.\r\n\n\n\n'On his way to this land, Dimitri spread news of the arrival of the individual to Adam and others. I am not sure of where Sally went to, which is why I must return back soon. I shall tell you of his business later : but you wished to know where we have just been.'\r\n\n\n\n'We\u0092ve just flown over the Sea Of Lost Spirits, the only thing that seperates the unity between the two great lands. It\u0092s inhabitants are alcoholics, aggressive souls that were banished long ago due to their disruptive and uncivilized nature. Their leader is Jack Daniels, a crazed drunk who rules the foul sea, as well as his doomed followers.'\r\n\n\n\n'The sea is made of pure alcohol, and is covered with a thin mist of alcohol fumes, ones which do not take to flames very well. The desparation of the alcoholics must have been at a height, or their intoxication mind blowing, for not often do they risk naked flames on the sea itself. We were lucky that my jet pack flames did not engulf the alcohol fumes and end our flight, but it is the only way for us to cross between the two lands.'\r\n\n\n\n'Why did we not just sail across, just as those back there do ?'\r\n\n\n\n'Not since the olden days has a person from either land tried to cross the sea : all the boats that set sail from the shore return covered in bloody limbs, alongside newly possessed bodies ready to exact revenge on the people of the land.'\r\n\n\n\n'But now to the present, and the future : you are in Tryptaminia, and have been sent here to follow Dimitri\u0092s earlier lead. It is the safest place separate from Phenethylaminia, as Chris will most likely try to follow you here. You must follow this creek until you go deep into the forest, and within there you will find Lucy, her Chairman Meo, and hopefully Dimitri. Do not stop to smell the flowers or pet the animals - for even though they are of much wonder and amazement, time is easily lost in this area of the world.'\r\n\n\n\n'I shall leave now to locate Sally, and bring her back to this land : and hopefully we will cross paths before too much trouble arises. Good bye, and good luck !'\r\n\n\n\nAnd with that, Katey let out a loud boom, and her jet pack rocketed her into the grey mist that lay behind her. I stood there, chilled by the sight of the Sea Of Lost Spirits : but the land in front of me cancelled every bad feeling I\u0092d experienced that previous night.\r\n\n\n\nAs I paced along the worn path, I quickly approached the forest : but not before absorbing the morning rays, and all the glory they held. I could make out activity by the edge of the forest, and no stranger site had I beheld in both lands, but tanned babies in hula flower chains dancing around carved wooden roses ! The preoccupied babies took no notice of me, and I went to admire them closer before I remembered Katey\u0092s advice, and went on.\r\n\n\n\nThe floor of the deep forest was blanketed in mushrooms, some bigger than the palm of my hand, their pungent aroma filling my nostrils with an acute sense of depth and insight. I could not resist but kneel down and sample one of the fine tasting fungi, and located the largest I could find. I knelt down and grasped the tough stalk, all the while the memory of Katey fading into oblivion.\r\n\n\n\nUp jumped a large, and overly inflated bull frog onto the mushroom, a very curious sight to say the least. And it became even more curious as the frog seemed to draw the bulk of the mushroom\u0092s weight into it\u0092s venom gland, growing larger and larger as it\u0092s seat shrunk to a pebble of dust.\r\n\n\n\nIf only I could have realized how dangerous my mouth opening awe of the situation would become. The bull frog stretched it\u0092s jaws, shooting it\u0092s venom straight down my open trap, and too late - I had already consumed a large quantity of the frog\u0092s venom before it was too late.\r\n\n\n\nI sprang up in horror, knowing I\u0092d been poisoned by the foul creature, and needed help quick. My mind flashed Lucy - she lived within this forest, and she must surely know what to do with me.\r\n\n\n\nSo I pelted on down the track, swerving left and right, all the while my vision shifting and my balance waivering. I\u0092d fallen over log and stone, clawing my way past vines and fallen trees, desperate to reach Lucy in time. If I did not reach her soon, then Chris would destroy the both worlds - and I would be responsible.\r\n\n\n\nI would be responsible for destroying all of life on this world !?! It would be my fault, and this is my first time here !?! If I do not make for the clearing soon, I shall die ! And then what will become of this land after that !?!\r\n\n\n\nI stumbled into the open space - but was this the right space ? Had I made a wrong turn back there and doubled back to the Sea again ? Am I lost within the forest, with no way out ? Will I ever reach Lucy before the end comes ? What have I done ?\r\n\n\n\nI collapsed in a nervous wreck at the entrance to the clearing, and sat shivering at my animosity towards the creatures of this land. My logical thought processes had broken down, and every thought I had was of the evil consequences of my life.\r\n\n\n\nIt was many hours before I woke up out of that recurring trance, to the sound of maniacal whispering in the bushes to my left. I could not make out any shapes beyond the first line of trees, but I quickly darted towards the mound in the centre of the clearing for cover. Had I not been asleep at the entrance for many hours, I might have been able to plan for the events about to unfold before my eyes ...\r\n\n\n\nAs I rounded the mound, the fair princess Lucy, the major gentleman Chairman Meo and the crafty leader Dimitri all came into view among many seats behind the cover of the mound. They all sat in dismay at the sighting of me. They immediately beckoned me closer, and Lucy opened her mouth to speak ...\r\n\n\n\nBefore she could though, her head rolled off her neck, and her skull was crushed by a large steel capped boot. Lucy\u0092s brain oozed with a runny liquid, spilling out across the ground, as I lay in shock and fear of the man standing on my saviour\u0092s head.\r\n\n\n\n'Aah. The white eye has come to the lords of Tryptaminia for help, and ends up being murdered by the well serving Cane. Erin - show yourself to the boy so he knows who his killer is !'\r\n\n\n\nFrom behind the dark and muscly Cane waddled Erin, a sloth like woman with an evil grin, and an immensely huge body. She had tied behind her the dead bodies of Chairman Meo and Dimitri, twisted and deformed into their binding ropes.\r\n\n\n\n'Well, well, well. It seems Katey isn\u0092t here to save you now, is she !' The unmistakable hiss of Chris sounded behind him, and he fast approached the mound, knife glinting in the sun, gripped extremely hard.\r\n\n\n\nThe three evils began to take turns in telling myself of my impending doom. 'As much as we hate to say this, but your arrival here last night has proved both good and bad for us. You have tempted myself to finally do what I have longed to do : murder my brother. Never again shall I be looked down upon in the night club scene again. You have organized for that annoying Ms. Kelly to be disposed of, as well as Torsten\u0092s incessent beating to be finally ended. Both Chairman Meo and Dimitri have met their ends, and not at all too late. Their jobs were far too serious to be rewarding, and their properness needed punishing. As for Lucy, she forms the final part of the equation needed to hand posession of the land to the four evil super powers : for Jack Daniels will be along shortly,\r\n\nand you shall meet him in person, individual. Aah, could this be him now ?'\r\n\n\n\nBut it was not. I could not be mistaken as to the sound of that whoosing scorching the tree tops, and in from the roof of the clearing came Katey, and Sally in her arms. They landed with a running thud, and ran towards their nearest opponent.\r\n\n\n\nI leant back as Sally\u0092s instantaneous administration came into force, quickly overpowering Erin\u0092s slow swipes, and choking her to death on a vine ripped from the mound nearby. Katey stood up to Cane, both sending power balls and plasma bolts at each other from near and far. Many times the wakes of these energy waves sailed by my ears, but Sally caught Cane\u0092s feet in her vine, and he was easily picked off.\r\n\n\n\nKatey and Sally spun round to see how I was getting along - and I realized why they were looking at me like that. I rolled just in time over Lucy\u0092s body for Chris\u0092s blow to strike the wet soil, Lucy\u0092s brain matter flying straight through Chris\u0092s lack of existance. Further and further he pushed me, until I was backed in a corner against a tree on the mound, and he was preparing to lunge at my throat.\r\n\n\n\n'Perform the candy flip ! Focus ! Perform the candy flip !' yelled Katey, as Chris charged at me, with blade pointed. Here goes, I thought.\r\n\n\n\nI sprung into the air, almost as if Katey had propelled me away from Chris\u0092s attack. I fumbled inside my pocket, withdrew the chunk of crystal, and landed poised behind Lucy\u0092s limp body. A loud squelch happened beneath my hand, and it began to glow.\r\n\n\n\nThe chunk of crystal in my hand was saturated with the brain fluid of Lucy, and was quickly heating up and flashing bright white. It was beginning to blind me, and I almost did not notice Chris running straight at me.\r\n\n\n\nI suddenly realized why they call it the candy flip. The bitter sweet substance dissolved in my mouth, just as Chris bore his blade down on me - with no effect whatsoever. I sheilded my body, but Chris was far worse off : his shadow of a body faded away, his contact with such a pure goodness as a candy flip destroyed all signs of his evil soul.\r\n\n\n\nKatey looked very reminiscint, but also gave me a false hopeful smile that gave me the chills. Sally looked sad, her alter lord Dimitri having been murdered due to her tidings with Jack Daniels.\r\n\n\n\n'I was unable to locate Chris, Cane or Erin in either land when I arrived,' said Sally, 'but I knew where Jack Daniel would be. His location was most certainly on the Sea Of Lost Spirits, and so Dimitri and I headed there. We set sail and fought the drunken man, and he was no match for our speed or agility. I sailed him forward to this forest, and returned back to Phenethyaminia to see how the white eye was holding up. I heard on the way here from \r\n\nKatey of the molotov cocktails - surely they were retaliation for my killing of their leader. I must have got back to shore just as you two had left - if I had gone over with you, maybe these three may have survived.'\r\n\n\n\nMy name - the white eye, or the individual - was due to my lack of pupil size, something which was strangely common in those parts. I, too, eventually lost my white eye in that land - which I attribute to those strange pills in Phenethyaminia, the toad venom in Tryptaminia, and the precious candy flip.\r\n\n\n\n'But how did I know how to perform the candy flip ?' I asked Katey, wondering how I managed to execute the maneuver, and think to consume the powerful combination.\r\n\n\n\n'You must realize that these lands are not of physical dimensions, but a world made up of your mind, only accessible by combining the two super powers. Every thing you have seen is but a hidden extension of you, and you already know of all that is in it. It is not luck that lead you to perform the candy flip - you knew how to do it all along, and only needed imagine doing it to perform it.'\r\n\n\n\n'But now, you must return to your world - for the land is quickly fading, and your time has come. Sally and I shall now send you home.'\r\n\n\n\nSally picked a nearby bush, while Katey constructed a crude pipe of her metallic piping and her jet pack. I laid back against the mound, puffing on the glowing resins of the flowers picked, thinking 'There\u0092s nothing like a good cone, there\u0092s nothing like a good cone, there\u0092s nothing like a good cone ...'"

(approx. 6:30pm)\r\n\n\n\nAll began slowly; smooth transparent shimmers of light defining dimension and propounding relation\u0085 \r\n\n\n\nThe Grateful Dead condense a magnificently chaotic jam: pulling it backward through interstellar space until finally it punctuates the atmosphere and floats gracefully back to the earth from which it was created\u0085 \r\n\n\n\nA buoyant sensation begins to thermally maneuver and spread itself throughout my body, outward from my heart and through the interwoven network of cells until it finds release through the skin. I am warm physically and feel the psychic tension of everyday reality dissipating like so much steam from a kettle. A simply delicious elatedness washes over me, not so powerfully and overwhelmingly as with MDMA, but smoothly, effortlessly\u0085 sly creeping passion flower. And, as T has forespoken, crystal in character: affording bright lucidity amid reality-deconstruction like a sober astronaut looking out on infinity.\r\n\n\n\nS and G are already spaceborne, soaring over some stroboscopic psychic landscape together and absolutely loving it, gleeful galactic panoramic outbursts swim through the room: \u0093you see that??\u0094 and \u0093look way down there!!\u0094 \r\n\n\n\n(approx.9:30pm) T and I boost with another 5mg TC-T-7, and assure the ladies that we are on the way to join them.\r\n\n\n\nCertainly no more than ten minutes elapse before a gentle wave comes along and silently carries us upward with its motion to warmer water where color frees itself and swims beneath my eyes. Synesthetic fluctuating sounds emerge surreal and psychosomatic structuring realigns itself adroitly. We are all the grand conductors in the orchestra of our own lives, but we are more: we are each the audience in whole\u0085 I feel the musical quality of the very air we breathe, and move my hands in concert with the pulsing rhythm of the cosmos.\r\n\n\n\nG is like an electrified bolt of consciousness. At some point I find myself alone with her and we peer the eternal distance in each other\u0092s eyes. She is absolutely explosive with energy, but so controlled!! Like a human superconductor inside a supernova. She attempts to speak, moving her mouth slightly\u0085and then falls silent as we both apprehend the comic uselessness of speech. We share a moment of absolute mental clarity that is both wordless and wonderful.\r\n\n\n\nAs T and I reach the crest of the wave, just as vision reigns resplendent and weight floats free, he reminds me about the DMT. I wait until I am confidently wading across the liquid plateau with bearings set, perhaps 5 to 10 minutes, and tell Trey that I am ready.\r\n\n\n\nThe two of us adjourn to his bedroom where there is sufficient light for the pipe. I relax and we go over the basics\u0085this is not my first experience with DMT but it is my first in a long time\u0085and simply ritualizing/preparing is very reassuring. I inhale slowly, steadily and with absolute delight as I taste that most splendid of all nature\u0092s flavors. It is all I can do to hold the smoke in as the world cascades away beneath me and I lose all tactile sensory input. Possibly 30 seconds elapse and shhhhhhhhhhifftttttt through into\u0085.(I hear T \u0093ok, release\u0094)so far away but I open my eyes as I exhale the colors of liquid crystal inner space in to outer space and he puts the pipe to my lips for the second toke and I try my hardest to concentrate on inhaling but the glass and smoke and flesh and breath become one before my eyes\u0085\u0085\r\n\n\n\nRrrrrrrrrrrrrrhhhffffffffff - shockwave through my body jolting me conscious\u0085 apparent crystallization of matter all around me\u0085felt even, like being within a sentient prism. All spatial perception seems to enfold itself in to a gravity well of such ineffable density that it is like floating on the event horizon of a black hole, a prudent observer to nothing less than a multidimensional miracle. T and I, flowing together, are not alone out here, but rather two of innumerable participants to bear witness in this moment\u0085 disembodied souls in hyperspace. \r\n\n\n\nI hear T say \u0093Breathe\u0094\u0085\u0085\u0085 and it is pure manifested Truth. The word, verbalized, is the original symbol of the noetic dreamscape we are treading. I just soak it all in.\r\n\n\n\nThe tryptamine/phenethylamine combination is remarkable. The DMT acts within my body as a catalyst, first noticed as a \u0091lightheaded\u0092 feeling throughout my limbs, and swiftly, over the course of roughly five minutes following initial comedown, penetrating my entire body\u0085the feeling is almost indescribable. It is as though every cell has conductively attuned, one by one, to the true vibration of existence, leaving the body a vessel for pure energy\u0085a channel of the Tao.\r\n\n\n\nAll together in the living room, the four of us are stargazing. S, now Venus- gloriously electrified and powerfully nude- plays her didgereedoo. The sound is absolutely primal. It summons forth archaic beauty in the mind\u0092s eye\u0085an audiovisual kaleidoscopic window back up the genetic chain. I peer up as I listen to the ancestral vibration.\r\n\n\n\nReflectively, I am brought forward to see 2C-T-7 as the chemical bridge which traverses the river of Cartesian Dualism. It is the span connecting cosmic imagination with human feeling. \r\n\n\n\nGoddess Bless."

        "report_text": "Ever since my first couple times doing DMT, i have had a far more difficult time remembering what happened, and there was a fear that kept me from taking the plunge too often. Both of these were cleared out of me the other night though when i smoked it again amongst new friends: it was once again lucidly available to my memory and i had the joy of attempting to put words to the unlanguageable. Enjoy!\r\n\n\n\nDOSE : 50mg synthetic DMT in a glass pipe on a small bed of dill, three large, hot, plasticy tokes: \r\n\n\n\nUpon inhalation, the trembling darkness before me crystallized instantly into a shimmering vortex of lime-colored tessera and began a meticulous implosion in upon itself. Pulses of sinuous electric energy shot along it from behind me and I could see them disappear down its infinite corridor. Each one came faster and faster and faster until this typhoon like tunnel was throbbing with supple, supernova pulsations. It was then that I began to accelerate, an auditory drone that seemed to flange at the edges of my being propelling me along. I couldn't believe the breakneck speed with which I was beginning to move, like a proton in a hyperspatial supercollider. The breathtakingly ecstatic sensation of being literally shot out of the confines of my corporeal body was overwhelming, and already my mind was grasping wildly about for some semblance of familiarity. No previous DMT journey had ever moved this fast. The vortex started coiling then, curling and cycling into its cylindrical self, and I became aware that it was but one strand in a warping and wefting dimension which was now materializing and taking on a thousand outlandish forms all around me. Ahead was an entirely ludicrous, tensile, concentric, mandala-like disco-medusa that wore about it a technicolor dreamcoat of fibrillating antennae, surrounded by an ultraviolet aura. Instantly I could tell it was alive: some sort of a sentinel. Then seemingly out of nowhere and from every direction at once came these freakish tentacles of liquid lapis lazuli. They began moving together with an almost orchestral hyperprecision, and I was completely mesmerized - it was like nothing I had ever seen. I had absolutely no idea what I was looking at - there must literally have been thousands of them - I was utterly flabbergasted. I knew I must find a way past this creature though, as extraordinary as she was. We were still cruising along at the speed of light, now descending backwards together through an amoeboid, octahedral gallery of iridescent vaults. It was at this moment that I became suddenly aware we were not alone. The vaults seemed to zoom explosively outward then and the gallery expanded ad infinitum into a gargantuan, labrynthine, almost interstellar space, and through every vault poured the miraculous and zany imps who make the tryptamine hyperdimension their home. The tentacles of lapis lazuli gathered these capricious, multi-colored enigmas in towards the center, and became the architectonic scaffolding of their new multi-dimensional reality, a world which I found myself dab smack in the middle of. It was like a liquid mind ecology of staggering and alien complexity, the mind as it crosses over into quantum warpdrive and migrates ever further out into the oceanic beyond. At this point the glorious geometries transcended what is even vaguely feasible in this three dimensional mundane, constantly concrescing into new and varigated permutations, exfoliating out of themselves what might be called hyperspherologies of the divine, and to look anywhere was to be shot clean through with scintillating amazement. Crowding and cramming themselves into my field of vision were thousands upon thousands of beings of every imaginable sort and many that were completely unimaginable. They were everywhere jabbering in indecipherable tongues, juggling incandescent neon microworlds of dancing beings, and morphing with a zen-like, diaphanous fluidity that remains a primal miracle no matter how often you lay your all too human eyes on it. The primordial intelligence being manifest before me was palpable, undeniable, transcendently amazing - it shook me to my core in a more-than-real gleeful profundity. All I could do was sit there in divine liquid awe, my soul gaping wide open, and stare at the incalculable proportions of bizarreness and the down right weird that lay before me. It was like being entertained by the 76,000 piece orchestra of an alien civilization in whose classical music each note is not merely a musical tone, but an entire world, each just as intricate and nuancical as our own. You have a sense of being swarmed by the whimsical mastermind artforms of an extremely eccentric Boolean contortionist, a diabolical merry go round of linguistic Rubix cubes, 13th dimensional millipedes saying themselves to themselves as they make love, and impossible Gordian knots dancing the jitterbug at a lyrical lightspeed: a gelatinous ballet of endlessly self-juxtaposing pirouettes. You realize all at once you have arrived and are now having darshan with this gigantically insectoid, otherworldly Oz.\r\n\n\n\nThey came at me again and again, a more than possible tsunami of opalescent combobulations, like rivers of music and miracles and clowns, the flood gates of my soul thrown wider than wide with the sheer magnitude of this dazzling, world-devouring spectacle. It was the primal, otherworldly bewilderness of the Andalusian gardens that grow in the antipodes of the mind, the crystalline vegetal perplexity of its delectable ecologies spilling and dripping and pouring like liquid diamonds from my eyes. The presence of what is awesome, what is wildly and passionately and numinously alive, filled every meridian in the vast continent of my expanded being, an intensity of joy and love and life coursing like heavenly ambrosia through my electrified veins. It was as though I myself was god, moving through liquid ecologies of god, the self-crystallizing emerald labyrinths of the tryptamine dreamtime, a marvelous infundibulum of plasmoidal calisthenics. What occurred was a total meltdown of everything I know and hold dear, utter surrender into the honeycomb lovewomb of the universe reborn, born anew in a thousand unendingly magnificent eyes, and Maya and Lila handheld spinning in sundream dandelions, my five senses spinning like a zillion gyroscopes round the centripetal amethyst of this all and everything. \r\n\n\n\nI was there, and then I was back - zap like before - I was back before I even knew I was back, the dimensions subsiding very quickly within me as the last few molecules of DMT were cracked wide open and gone. The room before me buzzed and shimmered like the most unlikely dream. The world? Oh yes - I remember - I like it there. Hello people. You look so normal and good. But wait, something just happened. What was that thing? Oh YES, OH MY LORD YES.....everything was still a shimmering mindmirage or bliss and joy and awe. WOW...... I think I said that: WOW...... \r\n\n\n\nTo think that we all spend hours there every night, after *we* have been metabolized away that is, and that every day the collectivity of human consciousness looks upon that miracle for over 50 billion hours, is more than any of us can even begin to begin to understand. Seven minutes spent in that dimension, the primal furnace of our being, is enough for most people to think about for the rest of their lives. How miraculously absurd and awe-inspiring is our situation as humans then, that we are somehow built around this certain little molecule, only four atoms away from serotonin, the neurotransmitter which mediates and colors every aspect of our waking lives. It is like the human body is a door, a portal, and DMT is the key that opens our experience to the all-possible, the everything dimension, which surrounds us on all sides though we see it not. That the simple quantum difference of four atoms can open this for anyone to see is, and will remain, the greatest, most mysterious enigma in this life. The day we unlock its secrets we will for the first time awaken from the dream."

        "report_text": "A composite essay of my first two DMT trips\r\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: This is a pale reflection of a bottomless mystery. The things I say it is, it is now - these are but linguistic shrouds I am able to cloak it in. Please don't think you know DMT from having read this, you don't. But DO please consider trying some, go extract it from a plant - then you will KNOW. Everything here is with closed eyes unless otherwise indicated - this is really the only way to go DEEP.\r\n\n\n\nThe small wooden pipe was in my mouth and a match was coming to light it. The scenario almost seemed like smoking pot except I knew the taste to be very wrong as the complex, sweetly acrid smoke filled my lungs. Anyway, my pulse never raced like this from the anticipation of getting stoned.\r\n\n\n\nThe first thing was a sense of dropping away, but to say downward would be too simple. There were all sorts of frequency modulations and crescendoed stacatto pops as the trip descended. This sound data was quiveringly involved with these visual architectonic dream waters that were beginning to emerge, dripping and slipping amongst themselves, and my being became overwhelmed by vacuous, gravity-like suction experiences which impelled me further in. Around me I felt a crowding in of beings as if the Celtic Faerie land of Fay had become momentarily co-present with where I was. I sensed them, but did not experience these creatures. The sucking experience took over for a while then, driving the morphological acrobatics of spacelove that lay before me. There was something about it that makes me think of a voluptuous alien seductress with big, fat lips pulling me to her body in the weirdest feeling embrace ever. It felt like I was being smeared sensually and lustfully around the space in some sort of vacuum-tube funhouse. At this point (maybe a minute into the experience) I started picking up something like the Escher painting of all those sets of stairs with figures descending by all manners of gravity, only its surfaces were emerald isles of what I can only describe as fractal Medusa liquid, serpentine and sexy. There was a thought that I was in a room full of aliens and they were playing with me, but that somehow they had conspired to make me this way - the alien carney music bar on the planet Tatooine in the Star Wars trilogy seems relevant.\r\n\n\n\nThen I had the thought (which just seems to pop up and not really pertain): 'What have I done! How did I get this way?' Meaning, how did I come to enter something so foreign that my petty human ontological premises and hopeful body of knowledge seem like a wrench trying to adjust a camel? At that point I lost any touch with my body and was thrust forward into complete and utter amazement. The world became so crammed full of intricacy to the nth that it seemed every nook and cranny in my spacetime was exfoliating little crystalline dancing worlds, bellowing ecstasy. It moved like snakes move: all rippling of muscle and sun glinting scales. I cannot emphasize enough the catapulting, titanic motions of this iridescent zigzag bottlerocket, this nuanced, whittling circus of form, this Brobignagian roller coaster safari across the jeweled plains of wonderland, straining the limits of the knowable.\r\n\n\n\nThis is where I was when I felt a certain sort of shockwave across the dome of the sky which gave me memory of the real world. I then entered this whole journey that I would call extrication. Going in was 'intrication' or delving into intricacy, so coming back out was sensibly extrication. The experience was very literally an incedible groping back out of this wild wooly thing until I made it 'out', which afterwards I realized was only the physical action of opening my eyes. The pipe was in my mouth - its touching my lips had been the reality shockwave I'd felt. The woman who was handling the pipe for me looked like a fractal Medusa as well, but incarnate - she was buzzing all over with this really freaky energy. I said something like, 'You expect me to call this a mouth?', a comment which was silenced by the stem of the pipe. One toke and I was out of my body again, yanked back through the scrim of the worlds into the blast furnaces of heaven.\r\n\n\n\nI 'came to' in some sense at this point and realized that I could do anything in a space like this, could instantly unfold my richest possible imaginings. 'O.K.', I said to myself, 'What about trying to do what you believe possible by your perceptual theory of higher dimensional experience?' You see, I got the idea that there is no reason why, in an inner experience, one has to have visions only in front of one. I began to believe this was an imprint that years of bringing the external world into construction of inner spaces had created, but was not necessary. I then tried to imagine what it would be like to see in every direction at once, i.e. what would a ball look like if you could see every side of it at once? I could sense it but not imagine it in my mind. So this is the challenge I set myself. It not only seemed to work (though with everything else going on inside, it was a bit like trying to do a sensitive physics experiment in the midst of a drunken bacchanal) but it did so immediately. I rushed upwards into this superspace that was a spun galactic ecology of stars, a swarming hive of dragonfly constellations . . . This was very profound, but in doing it, it seemed I had reduced the alien quality of what had been going on previous to this excursion.\r\n\n\n\nI let my will go then and tumbled forward into elfland. Terence McKenna is apt in calling these entities 'elves'. They are elves/not-elves. They don't appear, they kind of ooze out of the woodwork seductively and before you know it they're there - the whole realm is infested with these creatures like nothing else you could ever imagine. They do sing things that are like 'self-dribbling jeweled basketballs' or whatever you want to call them. They make Faberge egg concoctions with ingredient lists like: 1) space, 2) lust, 3) politics, 4) circus sideshows, 5) time, 6) gall bladders, 7) existential notions of polyfidelity, 8) cucumbers, 9) Beethoven's 5th symphony, 10) the smell of petunias, and so on. This is somewhat of an arbitrary list, but the point is, all my categories of mind fell away because they were being ceaselessly synthesized and re-synthesized into these hyperdimensional objects, undulating, ululating along. It makes me think of getting home from school when your mother says that she's baked you some treats, only these are like no treats Mom ever made, and when you see them you almost want to say, 'Aw, mom, you shouldn't have. I mean you really shouldn't have'. What you do with these elves is some sort of a game of catch, only the physics of the game has been replaced by the physics of synesthesia. In catching the things they threw, in playing with them, I participated in the ineffable mysteries that they were. This place is the Joycean 'Merry go raum'. Being there I came to understand the Heraclitus fragment: 'The Aeon is a child at play with colored balls'. It is this. As well I understand, 'Still the first day, All Fool's Day, here at the center.' It is this too.\r\n\n\n\nSo for what seemed like centuries I played with the trippy freaky elves and they kept bringing me into atrium after atrium in the antics annex, and all I could do was wonder when we would get to their front door. As far as I know, we never did. Instead they said many things, though I can't say they used what we would call a voice to accomplish this communication. I remember only parts of this. At first they said, 'Build this', indicating hyperspace. Later they amended this by saying, 'Build it. He will come.' from the movie Field of Dreams. Very funny.\r\n\n\n\nThen it was as though alarms started to go off, and the whole space was going through these quivering emergency elaborations. I get the image of a submarine movie sequence when I think back on this, just when it has been discovered on the surface, the periscope retracts and the whole interior goes into haywire, preparatory gymnastics as all the hatches are battened down. There is a phenomenally high-energy dynamic associated with this part, as they try to get you out and shut the great bronze dancing doors of hyperspace. It is as if everything is charged with imponderable electricities and is racing around because someone shouted: 'Places everyone!!' They start cramming your soul out of there with a million hands at once, grabbing you by twelve dimensions you never knew your body had. Finally, the thing shuts and there is a sense of finality to that, but just as soon you are on to the next thing.\r\n\n\n\nSlowly then it begins to make farewells and say its goodbyes. Ancient mythos holds that the world is supported by turtles 'all the way down', but as I came out of it, my sense was of jeweled great glass revolving elevators all the way down. I remember thinking that I was passing back through the 50,000 veils that the Sufis say the mystery has, one by one, and I clearly remember the awe I felt that each one of them was closed, sealed, and put away in a unique and voluptuous, succulent way. It was without question the most beautiful goodbye I have known in this life. There was no regret of leaving or longing not to leave, just an overpowering acceptance of the imminent return. This went on and upon opening my eyes I had this very zap experience and I was right back in this world, amazingly enough, only ten minutes gone. Slight tracers on light and then these gone too. I was amazed of the idea that one could go back there, could in fact just go there, that where I had been felt entirely like it was a whole hyperspace, raging right next door. I remember saying, and being very sure of this as I still am now, 'Those are the gods'. By which I meant, of all the things I've experienced in life, they are the most like real living gods, and should be called that. It was very interesting to me that I didn't need to process a whole lot, which I usually require after the mushrooms. Instead, I think I was in a state of being so existentially surpassed by the quality of what I had just been a part of, that I couldn't muster any sort of conceptual or descriptive response to it at all. By default, I was left with just a purity of acceptance for it - I just simply had nothing to put to it in any sense. Instead I resorted to looking wildly and deeply into other peoples eyes and by some existential-perceptual force, to impress upon them the utter beauty of what I had just been. This seemed to work somewhat, though probably not. I definitely felt I had been closer to the core of the real than ever before and that this mystery is front and center to who we are as humans, who we really are. I felt very connected to my universe, very sensitive and strong and in touch with things. Because I apparently have the gift of being able to remember it quite well (others do not), I have to live with memory of its being out there somewhere: very real, very powerful, very alive. There has not been an hour to pass since I did it that I haven't thought of it and tried again to reference it to this world, failing. I do feel it is a very important experience to have as a human being, and in some sense a whole lot safer than mushrooms or acid. I say this because I am aware that I usually have time and opportunity in a traditional trip to come up with weird ideas and believe them which can be hell to integrate when things return to normal. DMT seems to be so awe-inspiring, one is just so floored by it, that there is no chance for trying to figure it out.\r\n\n\n\nThis is left for when you return, spacecraft still steaming."

        "report_text": "Drifting deeply into the visual ebb and flow of the DMT I just walked through the thin fabric of the visual fractal fantasy. It was like a gauze layer of the dream just separated and boom .. it was like walking from a dark night into a brightly lit casino in Las Vegas. I felt like I had walked behind the scenes into a series of rooms. Everything was prime color cranked up to it s fullest potential. The images were clear, crisp and vivid. many times more vivid then the early pre-room images.\r\n\n\n\nThere were two people a man and a women or a girl and a boy. They appeared to me like simple balloon computer generated images. As soon as I stepped in the room, they glided up to me and spoke directly to me. They kept saying welcome back and words like: the big winner, he has returned, welcome to the end and the beginning, you are The One! As I looked around the room I felt the sense of some huge celebration upon my entry to this place. Bells were ringing, lights flashing fear began to rise in me as I felt the deep change in my world. The sprites begin to lead me around the room showing me how all my life they had been preparing me for this return. I was shown dozen of experiences simultaneously in my life, that had lead up to and been clues to this moment. I was shown in a flood and a onslaught of images, thoughts, situations, raw feelings that everything had been building to this moment. That this moment had been planned.\r\n\n\n\nThey told me it was a gift. That I had been selected to be The One. I felt feelings of huge relief, excitement and fear in the sprites. At this moment in the experience I became afraid for my life. I felt that this gift would cost me my life. I did not want to be The One. The sprits felt this fear in me and begin to hold my hands and arms rushing me deeper into their world. I felt their fear and I begin to believe that I had stepped out of the dream, out of the drug, out of my body and mind and into this super world. I begin to believe in the transformation. As I walked deeper I could see standing in the middle of the room, in the center of this place, an object similar to an hour glass. It was slowly turning over. I became aware that this vessel, as it tipped over, transferring its contents from the small red end to the larger blue end was transforming me. I felt my humanity slip out as I was filled with this new powerful light. A light of greater perception, of clarity. It felt like returning home. It felt familiar. It felt like I was waking up from a hollow, pale dream of reality. I felt god like and omnipotent. I realized the this gift was not only a gift but equally a death sentence for my physical body. I felt like I had been chosen to receive this not out of benevolence but out of a need to release this power and perception There had to be The One, to relieve the others. There had to be The One who perceived completely. I felt like Christ at the moment of realization of godhood and the inevitable moment of his crucifixion. I also felt like all this knowledge and perception was far too large to be processed by my physical mind and that death was the obvious transition.\r\n\n\n\nAs this moment of realization hit me I felt the sprites smile and step back. They told me I WAS The One and this WAS real and that it would never end.\r\n\n\n\nThey said do you not believe..... then see. \r\n\n\n\nAt this moment I sat up (in the real world) and opened my eyes. This moment true panic set in. I was deeply hallucinating. The real world was being covered, transformed into a psychedelic kaleidoscope of energy. Every surface had something like movie film, one image after another lined up like film shown through an overhead projector. These were the prime images of our symbolic nature. Slowly rolling over every surface. like the sprites of the objects. I felt I was seeing time in a singularity. I felt like I was seeing the symbolic patters like a second perception of true meaning. In the real room there were two people sitting next to me. When I looked at them I felt reassured momentarily. Then they exploded into dozens of two dimensional layers of light. Looking like computer generated futurists paintings. Wafer thin halos created the shapes of my friends. Dave looked up at me and said Welcome Back causing me to panic. Because when he said welcome back I did not think it was back to reality but back into the fold of this super world I was in. Back as there chosen one or at least one amongst them. I perceived Dave and Poon as personal guides or Guardians or gatekeepers there to welcome me into this new exalted state. That moment striped me of my world, my truths leading me to believe that my hallucinations were truth. I once again had the crashing feeling of winning, of being chosen, and being forced to receive this unwanted sentence of total vision. I had this crash as I could see once again the cause and effect of my being there and the price I would have to pay. I was the Bean King and the price of my gift would be perceptual transcendence but physical death.\r\n\n\n\nAt this time I felt a collapsing feeling as I gave in to the experience excepting my fate. I remember thinking that the hour glass had turned a little farther and I was pouring out of this life into my new one. I said out loud I am dying. Then I lost the support of my body, my self, my existence and I began to drift.\r\n\n\n\nDave then touched my leg I remember being drawn back into my body and thinking to hell with this I am not going to die, not yet and I felt the sprites smiling around me looking at me. I felt the fear. I felt the exhilaration of my visions. I was back in the sprites room. Even though this place was vibrant and psychedelic it was within my ability to comprehend. The sprits began there pitch at me being a winner and The One. I felt they were taking me back down the hallway to open those iconic, electric vision and to my death. I then said out loud again I am dying to which Dave responded only three more minutes and you will be all right.\r\n\n\n\nThree more minutes.. Three more minutes was like a life raft that I sailed out of that world. As soon as I was able to believe that in three more minutes I would be normal again and everything began to fade. I felt in control of my body and my life. Slowly I drifted out of the their world, back through the gauzy world of colors and patterns. With a little extra coaxing from my friends I was able to wake up and separate my self from that moment.\r\n\n\n\nI still vibrate from the experience.\r\n\n\n\nI am very grateful to have been with my friends."

        "report_text": "\"The walls were breathing, and I was dying. Or maybe I was being born. I couldn\u0092t tell anymore.\"\r\n\n\n\nIt was 2009, my freshman year at college in Tempe, Arizona, a time of self-discovery, new friendships, and a bit of reckless curiosity. College life swept me up like a desert whirlwind, and I quickly found myself surrounded by a group of adventurous friends. Together, we explored everything: late-night conversations that stretched into dawn, music that seemed to rewrite reality, and the occasional mind-expanding trip through weed, mushrooms, and LSD. Psychedelics weren\u0092t just a pastime; they were a fascination. I was hooked on the mysteries they promised to unveil. But there was one substance that always lingered at the edges of our conversations, whispered about with a mix of awe and trepidation: DMT. They called it the \u0093spirit molecule,\u0094 a gateway to other dimensions, an experience that could reveal the very fabric of existence.\r\n\n\n\nOne night, during one of our usual long conversations beneath the warm, golden glow of dorm room string lights, I confessed a thought that had been haunting me for years: \u0093Do you think we\u0092re just... gone when we die? Like, just a switch that flips?\u0094 I hesitated, then added, \u0093Or do you think we go somewhere else, become someone else?\u0094\r\n\n\n\nKyle leaned back on the couch, strumming his guitar absentmindedly. His answer was casual, but it lodged itself in my mind like a splinter. \u0093Maybe you don\u0092t figure it out until you\u0092ve crossed over.\u0094 Crossed over. The phrase stuck with me, both haunting and thrilling.\r\n\n\n\nFor me, curiosity wasn\u0092t just a passing feeling. It was an itch that had to be scratched. And this time, I needed to know. A week after my conversation with Kyle, I reached out to a friend known for his knack for creating these mystical concoctions and asked if he could make some DMT for me. He didn\u0092t hesitate.\r\n\n\n\nA warm Saturday afternoon arrived, and my dorm room transformed into something sacred. Three of my closest friends gathered, not to join me, but to bear witness. They circled me like curious but uneasy spectators. Kyle sat cross-legged on the floor, picking at his guitar strings. The notes were disjointed, clashing in the air like a broken melody. Rachel perched on my desk chair, her knee bouncing anxiously, the fabric of her jeans twitching under her restless hand. Jake was the stillest, seated on the couch. His eyes kept flicking between me and the pipe in my hand, as if trying to silently measure the distance between the known and the unknowable.\r\n\n\n\nThe room was a mess, a collage of college life: open textbooks, half-empty bags of chips, discarded socks. But we had created a tiny island of focus, arranging the space with care. Sunlight flooded through the window, turning the chaos into a strange, golden still life. I prepared the pipe with an almost religious reverence, grinding my best weed and sprinkling the precious DMT crystals on top. The crystals shimmered faintly in the sunlight, fragile yet powerful, as though they carried the secrets of the universe within them.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Just breathe slow,\u0094 Kyle murmured. I nodded. The pipe felt heavy in my hands, as if it held the weight of everything I didn\u0092t know. My heart pounded like a war drum in my chest, and every instinct screamed at me to stop. But curiosity swallowed fear. I had to do this. I took a deep breath, lit the mixture, and inhaled.\r\n\n\n\nThe first hit burned. Bitter, acrid, like scorched plastic. I coughed hard, my lungs protesting, but my friends urged me to try again. The second inhale was smoother. Deeper. Heavier. The room started to shift, the sunlight thickening into golden syrup. My skin prickled. The third hit hit me like a freight train. The room was gone.\r\n\n\n\nThe walls oozed like molten wax, their surfaces unraveling into waves of violent reds, electric blues, and greens that pulsed as if alive. My blanket wasn\u0092t fabric anymore; it twisted and warped, its fibers turning into veins of pure color, breathing, heaving like a living organism. A low hum filled the air, vibrating through me. It wasn\u0092t sound, it was something deeper, like the universe itself humming a song too old for human ears to hear. The hum swelled, deepened, and surged into a deafening roar, like a windstorm tearing through the fabric of reality. Not wind. A force. Invisible. Relentless. It yanked me backward, out of myself. My body was gone. I was weightless, untethered, falling. No, not falling. Being pulled.\r\n\n\n\nA tunnel opened in front of me, vast and dark and endless. Its edges shimmered, alive with fractals that spiraled and twisted into infinity. I tried to scream, but my voice didn\u0092t exist. Panic surged. \u0093I\u0092m dying.\u0094\r\n\n\n\nMy thoughts tumbled, frantic, desperate. \u0093This is it. My friend gave me the wrong drug, and I\u0092m going to die. My parents, what will they think? My mom, she\u0092ll be so upset. I didn\u0092t even get to say goodbye to my brother and sister.\u0094\r\n\n\n\nThe tunnel consumed me, pulling me into its infinite depths without mercy or pause. And then, suddenly, the fear vanished. It melted, like ice under a blazing sun. I drifted weightlessly, untethered, and for the first time, truly free. My body was gone, and with it, every worry, every fear, every part of the \u0093me\u0094 I thought I was. I looked down and saw myself, my physical form lying limp on the bed. Jake\u0092s hand hovered near my shoulder, his mouth open, caught in a half-formed question. \r\n\n\n\nRachel whispered something to Kyle, her lips trembling. I should have felt panic, but instead, I felt peace. A quiet, profound peace that spread through me like warm light. That body isn\u0092t me anymore, I thought. And just like that, I let go. The peace carried me into the void. Endless. Infinite. It wasn\u0092t dark; it was full, alive, humming with energy. Shapes materialized, geometric, perfect, fractals that spiraled infinitely, folding and multiplying in patterns too vast and intricate for the limits of my mind to grasp.\r\n\n\n\nThen came the light. It started as a pinprick in the distance, faint and unassuming. But it grew rapidly, devouring the void. Blinding. Consuming. The light pulled me in. Faster. Harder. I hurtled toward it, a comet flung across the universe. And in a single, brilliant flash, I passed through.\r\n\n\n\nOn the other side, the void gave way to a space both alien and familiar. The walls shimmered, white, sterile, but alive with faint fractal patterns that pulsed and shifted beneath their surface. The air felt sharp and electric, humming with energy, as if the room itself was breathing. In front of me stood a figure cloaked in white. Her gown flowed like liquid light, and her mask and protective eyewear glinted, reflecting shapes that didn\u0092t belong to this world. She moved with precision, yet her presence felt impossibly gentle, almost sacred. She wasn\u0092t just a doctor. She was a midwife. The realization slammed into me with the force of a tidal wave. I\u0092m being born.\r\n\n\n\nGrief overtook me. I sobbed, raw and inconsolable. I had died. I had left everything behind: my family, my friends, my entire life. The weight of it was unbearable. The midwife lifted me gently, her gloved hands impossibly steady, and handed me to a woman. My new mother. She was radiant, tears streaming down her face. Her smile was warm, welcoming. The midwife lifted me gently, her gloved hands impossibly steady, and handed me to a woman. My new mother. She was radiant, tears streaming down her face. Her smile was warm, welcoming. But to me, she was a stranger. This wasn\u0092t my family. This wasn\u0092t my life. I wailed, thrashing in protest, grief pouring out of me like a broken dam. Then, she placed me on her chest. Her warmth enveloped me, soothing the storm inside. I could hear her heartbeat steady, strong, and unshakable. The rhythm calmed me, each beat an anchor.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Everything is going to be alright,\u0094 she whispered, her voice impossibly soft. \u0093Mommy\u0092s here.\u0094 The grief dissolved. My crying slowed. Peace crept back in, wrapping me in its embrace. I closed my eyes, surrendering completely.\r\n\n\n\nThe next thing I knew, I was back in my dorm room. The return wasn\u0092t a jolt but a slow, seamless drift; like emerging from the depths of a dream, only to find yourself in a world that felt both familiar and foreign. I blinked, my vision sluggishly adjusting to the dorm room around me. The air felt heavy, thick with the residue of something I couldn\u0092t name. My chest rose and fell as I took in each breath, my lungs reacquainting themselves with the rhythm of being alive. The soft hum of instrumental music tethered me, its gentle notes weaving reality back together.\r\n\n\n\nThe sunlight through the window regained its weight, grounding me in a reality that no longer felt entirely my own. My friends hovered close, their faces a mosaic of awe and relief. Kyle\u0092s hand trembled slightly as he passed me a glass of water, his voice cautious.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093What did you see?\u0094 I stared at him, the weight of what I\u0092d experienced settling into me like a stone at the bottom of a river. I shook my head slowly, a faint, inexplicable smile tugging at my lips.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Everything.\u0094"

        "report_text": "My Relationship With DMT\r\n\n\n\nI read that NN, DMT is a key to a doorway that opens up other dimensions. I had also heard that behind everyday reality is an unutterably strange, mental universe that DMT would show me.\r\n\n\n\nWhen I finally attracted DMT into my life I was afraid of it. I had a little baggie in my possession. I looked at it, smelled it and feared it for several weeks. I read quite a few trip reports of DMT experiences, I talked to people who had a relationship with DMT and I listened to podcasts on the subject but in retrospect it was ALL entirely irrelevant to the experience\u0092s that I have had.\r\n\n\n\nNightly I would contemplate the DMT baggie and try to imagine what another dimension would be like. I had read that nothing I could do could possibly prepare me for the leap that I was determined to make.\r\n\n\n\nOne night while in contemplation a lyric in a song spoke to me and it said \u0093my patience is waning\u0094 I did not want to do DMT on this night, however I felt led to. I must, this very evening, take the leap.\r\n\n\n\nI sat on the couch and put the tiniest fragment into the pipe, I lit her up and inhaled deeply, at first nothing happened and I doubted that the changa that I was in possession of was the real deal. Then an intense but not too strong mental feeling enveloped me. It only lasted for 30 seconds or so but I knew that this DMT was the real deal.\r\n\n\n\nAs I got my courage up I added a few more fragments and tried again. I had made myself a place in pitch darkness and I saw gentle visions. I was aware that these were sub-breakthrough experiences. They were not overwhelming, quite beautiful, lovely and I didn\u0092t feel any fear.\r\n\n\n\nOver successive nights I continued with my adventures. I played music in the pitch black and I enjoyed various visions, each one different and unique. One time a psychedelic spirit lady visited me.\r\n\n\n\nI was quite pleased, happy and content with sub-breakthrough experiences. I did not want anything more. Then one night after about 7 consecutive nights the little pile of crystals that I put into the pipe did not work. Then one night after about 7 consecutive nights the little pile of crystals that I put into the pipe did not work. I inhaled deeply as usual but nothing happened, so\u0085. I tried again with a similar quantity. \r\n\n\n\nI started the music at the same time as the inhale. I was expecting another sub-breakthrough experience but no\u0085.woosh and wow, I was instantly transported into a different world of colour, light and magnificent design. I was overwhelmed but not afraid. The experience was so powerful, intense and brand new for me, it was a roller coaster ride and I was hanging on for dear life.\r\n\n\n\nThe trip was mercifully short, 4 minutes and 14 seconds to be exact. I know this because the music and the trip were inexplicably intertwined, the trip concluded in time with the track.\r\n\n\n\nAfterwards I said to myself that I had \u0093seen\u0094\r\n\nIt was definitely a breakthrough experience.\r\n\n\n\nAt this early stage in my relationship with DMT I did not consider DMT to be a key that opened a doorway to another dimension. I labeled the experiences that I was having as visionary states.\r\n\n\n\nI was so thrilled with my pitch black music DMT breakthrough trips that I did not try anything else for quite some time. Every single trip was different and unique. \r\n\n\n\nEach time before I turned off the light I would contemplate, almost meditate on the size of the pile of crystals in the pipe. Almost always I was afraid to take the toke. Sometimes I would stare at the pipe for many long moments before plucking up the courage to hit the lighter.\r\n\n\n\nWhy was I afraid? \r\n\n\n\nIn all my DMT trips I have never experienced any fear during the trip but sometimes very intense power all the way up to 100% of what I can handle.\r\n\n\n\nBefore I hit the pipe the fear that I am familiar with is because I do not know where I am going. As I have said every single trip is different, sometimes radically different.\r\n\n\n\nI don\u0092t like weed or tobacco so I fill the pipe with a legal smoking blend and then sprinkle the DMT crystals on top. I use a jet lighter and hold the pointed, directional flame as far away from the crystals as possible so as to gently heat them until they bubble and smoke up. The DMT crystals that I know are orange, when heated they quickly turn into liquid and soak into the bedding of herbs.\r\n\n\n\nOne night I was in the back of the truck camping out. It has a sleeping compartment with carpet on the walls. I thought I would try something different so I got cosy with the lights on. I took my toke and guess what happened. No trip at all but rather the whole world went quiet. I felt deep peace and tranquillity and experienced silence.\r\n\n\n\nI was keen for more so I put a song on repeat and hit the pipe again. New and different is an understatement\u0085.\r\n\n\n\nA multitude of small angels and fairies came out of the carpet covered walls, they were actually made out of carpet. They danced and danced and danced for me.\r\n\n\n\nThere was no power and intensity with this trip, it was really easy and fun. Eventually it would start to fade so I\u0092d pack another pipe and it would come back fully. Everything inside the sleeping cabin became bright, shiny and new. The mattress which is maroon in colour became brilliant, the designs on the pillows became sharper in contrast and exceedingly bright in colour. I never wanted this trip to end. Eventually it started to fade and a subsequent pipe did not bring it back. I thanked the DMT spirits and expressed my profound gratitude knowing full well that in all likelihood I would never visit this place again. They faded and faded so I said goodbye.\r\n\n\n\nAt this same camping spot, we were by a slow meandering river, my mate told me that if I do DMT by the river the water spirits would come out and show themselves. I had some kind of expectation but the water spirits were a thousand times more than I could ever have hoped for\u0085.\r\n\n\n\nThey came out, many and varied, water spirits\u0085.some quite huge, they rose up from the depths, some came really close to me and danced. I called out in ecstasy, oh God you are so beautiful, I was enraptured.\r\n\n\n\nI also received a personal revelation during this trip.\r\n\n\n\nAnother notable trip was on the shore of a massive lake. In the heart of the DMT journey the water turned a turquoise/purple colour and astonishingly the waves behaved in an entirely alien manner. There were criss cross waves over lapping each other and coming in at 45 degree angles all the way to the shore. I couldn\u0092t believe that this was an hallucination, it was real.\r\n\n\n\nOn other trips the clouds were made up of sharp angles, triangles and squares around the edges of the cloud mass. In one of these journeys, staring deep into the alien, angular clouds I gazed away to contemplate some rock formations for a moment then when I looked back the sky was entirely different. I must emphasise that these visions look absolutely 100% as real as anything I have ever seen straight. They are not like mushroom or LSD visuals they are so real.\r\n\n\n\nBack to pitch black darkness music trips. On a small pile of crystals I have tripped for up to 3 hours (I kid you not) spectacular vistas, constantly changing and revealing more and more wonder, gentle, beautiful and lovely. \r\n\n\n\nI have seen many things from this Earthly world. People, sheer rock cliff faces, forests, leaves, all absolutely so real that I reach out to see if I can touch them only to find that they are holograms.\r\n\n\n\nI have been visited by spirit people who play around me and sometimes during powerful, intense or difficult parts of the trip someone is standing right next to me.\r\n\n\n\nI have also seen thousands of other-worldly things that defy description. Beautiful, beautiful, inexplicable things. I can remember them but I cannot for the life of me explain what they look like. They move around and come close to me then float off and away.\r\n\n\n\nNow\u0085.I really have been to other dimensions. During one of my very long pitch dark music trips I went somewhere else. I saw beings, some human other ones were cartoonish large physical beings. There was no fear or aggression, this was a society of peace, cooperation and harmony. I was there for a long time, they all seemed busy and engaged in what they were doing and how they were socialising.\r\n\n\n\nI also went to a machine world, a stupendously, enormous, possibility infinite machine. It was alive, a living machine. I was able to observe a multitude of tiny working, living machine components. Every one had a unique function and they all worked in harmony, appreciation and indeed  love for one another. They valued each other for the function that each so perfectly performed. Together they were all doing a job and it was in celebration. The notion came into my mind that perhaps this/these machines were producing consciousness!\r\n\n\n\nIn recent times I have been being taught something new by the DMT spirits. I have been tripping in a couple of places in the garden and in the large decked out shed.\r\n\n\n\nI am learning to disconnect from normal, everyday, consensus reality. DMT shows me glimpses of a paradise world that seems to exist magically right behind the normal, everyday, boring world.\r\n\n\n\nWhen I am distracted and not paying attention to the ordinary world I suddenly realise that the garden and the trees are really an enchanted and magical place of phenomenal beauty and intrigue. My immediate reaction is to focus my attention directly on the things in this new world and then they instantly disappear and I am back in the boring world. \r\n\n\n\nDMT began to send me colourful beautifully designed orbs which I am instructed to focus my eyes on. The orbs move and I follow them to a specific point. Then the magical world reveals its self but I must not look at it directly or it will disappear.\r\n\n\n\nIt is like looking at a magic eye picture. The image just looks like gobbledygook until I lose focus on the surface print and lo and behold a picture is revealed. I used to love magic eye pictures.\r\n\n\n\nAnyway, I have somewhat moved beyond needing the orbs. There is a way to observe the magical world without focusing on it. I see everything, all at once without a focal point. This is an otherworldly thing to attempt to do but very rewarding. \r\n\n\n\nDeep magic is all around, I have seen it."

        "report_text": "I had vaped DMT twice before on this day and this third go around came after a break of several hours.\r\n\n\n\nThe first experience was 11 mgs with not much to bring back other than I was in a bizarre landscape with these beams of light coming down from the sky or ceiling. Anthropomorphic entities were rushing towards these beams and when they entered the beams their limbs multiplied and they became hyper-spiders.\r\n\n\n\nI don\u0092t have much more to report other than picking up another English word in the rainbow blinking marquee and that word all in caps was CATS.\r\n\n\n\nMy second experience was with 17 mgs. Also not a lot to report. The marquees were everywhere and spinning into disks and other textures. I wound up in a pink hilly space full of these marquees and alien structures and entities telling me to freaking breakthrough already LOL. A bit creepy. Yet also tempting to increase the dose.\r\n\n\n\nMy third experience was 22 mgs. Please keep in mind I am older and profoundly sensitive to drugs so it basically hit me like a solid 44 mgs.\r\n\n\n\nIn coming back to DMT I have tried higher doses - 23 and 25 mgs. 25 mgs yielded the Heaven and Hell Inside My Head report [on DMT Nexus] but my memory of it was not even at half of the level of intensity of the current experience. The thing about this 22 mgs is I had really refined my vaping technique at this point and I vaped it fast and hard, getting most of it in on the first hit, holding a long time and lightly coughing I vaped it fast and hard, getting most of it in on the first hit, holding a long time and lightly coughing (rare for me with DMT - good hit!) visible vapor, then finished it off with a decent second hit. The third hit was clear - no visible vapor.\r\n\n\n\nIt started immediately and was undeniable and irresistible.\r\n\n\n\nIt started with me rocketing down these sinusoidal paths at about Warp 9. They were square bordered corridors, in a blacker than black, shiny tone that had vertical dividing lines and colorful multi-faceted . . . things . . . inhabiting them. I could not control my path as I shot through these tunnels. I could see it split off into other dimensions, left and right, up and down and off to diagonals but I just kept warping in an uncontrollable manner.\r\n\n\n\nI got the strong sense I had taken too much. I tried to mentally buckle up, as I know this is part of the bargain and can happen at any time. I also knew I only had one person to blame.\r\n\n\n\nEver since I was privileged to spend about 12 years living with a gorgeous, regal, highly intelligent and friendly brown street cat I have had a great love for and appreciation of the color brown and all of its hues.\r\n\n\n\nI made it to the end of the tunnel network and it\u0092s hard to describe but the tunnels just started opening up and expanding and suddenly I was in a layered bright circular, glowing and shining brown landscape, that was divided not only in terms of horizontal layers but also had vertical subsections. There was a DEEP and powerful sense or feeling of deja vu. Some time, some life, some when, some dimension, I had been here before. My perspective was from the outside of the sphere or curve. In other words, the whole landscape was curving towards me in a convex manner.\r\n\n\n\nEach subsection was inhabited by an extremely pushy and alien entity. These entities were compact, mechanical, square or boxlike and had a lot of protruding and moving objects. They were bright and colorful, radiating light and interest and dominance.\r\n\n\n\nThis \u0093landscape\u0094 was rolling towards me very rapidly and in repetitive waves, with the motion being top to down. It would rapidly roll forward, I would see the dividing lines and the divisions would resolve into individual entity rooms. The boxy, machine entities would see me, rush forward with all kinds of prody, pokey, protruding rods, wires, cones, mechanical eyes and more.\r\n\n\n\nI kept trying to ask them for help for Nemo and I but that was not going over well in this space. They were NOT taking requests. They were very VERY interested in who had dropped into their highly organized world and really wanted to know more about me. Their intentions were good, it was just so high paced, frenetic and INTENSE. Absolutely overwhelming.\r\n\n\n\nThe space was exquisitely beautiful, alien and operating on a much higher, much more organized level that was very fast and vibrational than consensual reality. The word filters when applying to consensual reality and the concept of being stripped of all filters was perfect in this situation. I was as psychically naked in there as someone who still has an \u0093I\u0094 left could be. I was as psychically naked in there as someone who still has an \u0093I\u0094 left could be. \n\n\n\nThere was no sense of the sacred or numinous here. Rather just an excessively alien realm completely jacked up on an overwhelming level of speed and intensity.\r\n\n\n\nThe brown layers were very highly polished and had an inner glow or light as was everything on the entities and there was a sense of openness or vastness about the space. The body load was massive. My heart was pounding, my hands were curling into claws, or so I thought.\r\n\n\n\nMy husband said I did moan and groan a bit. If asked I would have said I was gasping for breath and exhaling in a way that made \u0093phew!\u0094 sounds.\r\n\n\n\nI kept trying to not panic and would try to fall back on peace, love, healing, acceptance, integration, intentionality, my personal mantra. I\u0092d make it to acceptance (good!) then just lose it (and myself for a bit) as I got OVERWHELMED by the vision. This happened more than once with the competing/partitioned thought of, \u0093Well this would be an interesting way to die.\u0094 Also telling the entities I loved them but goodbye because I probably wasn\u0092t going to be able to dose at this level again soon. I knew exactly how I had gotten there - it was my choice and action.\r\n\n\n\nThe situation eventually changed and I was in a very tall, rather tight vertical space with entities and machines that were all moving to the left in a circular manner. The vibe was pure party. The more I was there the more I started to smile and chuckle. It\u0092s like I was being injected with a bit of ecstasy. I don\u0092t mean MDMA. I mean the refined, purified SOURCE of ecstasy. I got a mental injection.\r\n\n\n\nI wound up in an odd miniature \u0093play\u0094 city with spinning, circular pastel rings that were inhabited by little entities, vehicles and habitations. Everything here was pastel, small and toy or play like. I realized that the brown geometry alien machine entities had sent me to hyperspace preschool because I JUST COULD NOT TAKE IT!\r\n\n\n\nAgain the emotion was of HIGH humor. The ecstasy injection effects were lingering.\r\n\n\n\nIt was about at this point in Shpongle\u0092s I am You that the line came up, \u0093I always take just a little bit too much . . . oh my Grandmother would kill me!\u0094 This is where I started kind of laughing out loud. I realized at that time I had lost the music for awhile. It was good to be back at such a humorous point.\r\n\n\n\nI was also being brushed by weird tactile hallucinations as my full body sense returned.\r\n\n\n\nWhen I first opened my eyes the room was coming back but shimmered as if broken up into giant rainbow raindrops.\r\n\n\n\nAs I sat up to type my body control was difficult, typing was slow and plodding, single word, pause, single word. This improved at a steady rate.\r\n\n\n\nI was left a bit shaken and overwhelmed, yet laughing. That was definitely enough DMT for today.\r\n\n\n\nThe day after I feel calm yet oddly close to death. Apparently I took a big chomp out of my left cheek while in hyperspace.\r\n\n\n\nI am just trying to take things in and breathe. The memories of yesterday are very immediate and intense. This is going to take a little time to process/integrate."

        "report_text": "A little background on myself:\r\n\n\n\nAlthough I have a very conservative Christian background, I abandoned religion in all its forms about ten years ago, choosing to live free of confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance by fully examining every belief and every claim I was presented with, and not forming beliefs until I felt there was sufficient reason for it. Since I was still involved with religion, however, I began expanding my mind mainly using LSD and mushrooms (I have tripped on LSD something like 20 times and on mushrooms about the same).\r\n\n\n\nMushrooms stopped being enjoyable for me, most likely due to the fact that I descended into a very sedentery lifestyle, ate awful food, got fat, and started smoking cigarettes. They also reminded me that this lifestyle is horrific and disturbing in a very visceral way, and prompted me to change my lifestyle  - that's another story, but I bring this up to say that one of the things I was worried about with DMT was that it would treat me the same way - the imagined mutilation and self-devouring themes of my last mushroom trip were NOT something I was interested in repeating or amplifying in any way.\r\n\n\n\nThis is all fairly pertinent background information. Now onto the trip:\r\n\n\n\nI had heard many things about DMT and watched many videos on the topic as well as 'The Spirit Molecule' documentary. Finally I was introduced to a person who is in the know, who is not an amateur, who came to represent to me the very essence of professional chemistry competence - think a humble, very smart, visibly dangerous, but down to earth and kind shaman version of 'Heisenberg.' Heisenberg the Shaman. This guy had the best of the best, and I came to trust him implicitly. So when he said he had the best DMT possible, I was ready to make the trip - several hours from where I live. I took with me my friend, who is a recovering alcoholic and was in the middle of one solid year with no drug use whatsoever. This, however, was different; this was not a 'drug experience' but a portal into the realization of Truth Itself - perhaps that was just the justification we used, but I at least believed that.\r\n\n\n\nThere was a designated 'blast-off chair' that we took turns sitting in. It was me, my friend (A), this 'Shaman' guy (B), the guy who owned the space we were in (C), and several other folks who did not care to join in. We sat in a circle, talking, with the music on. 'C' urged us all to wear a blindfold and keep our eyes closed, as this would amplify the intensity of the visuals. Ideally, he said, music would be off and people wouldn't be talking - it should be done in the dark and in silence. It wasn't ideal by his standards, but he was sure we would be fine as we were seasoned trippers.\r\n\n\n\nWe were using a large vaporizer pipe with a 'blowtorch' lighter. All was prepared expertly by B, who held and lit the pipe for us. 'A' went first, taking a large rip and holding it in as long as possible. His eyes remained wide for a few moments, and then seemed to close involuntarily. We all watched as he settled into the chair and remained there as if in a trance, motionless. We all chatted amiably about this and that until about fifteen minutes later, when we noticed he was laughing out loud, his eyes still closed. He chuckled to himself for a while, then it tapered off into another minute of silence. He opened his eyes and just said, 'Man.'\r\n\n\n\nMy turn came and I was visibly nervous. I am very interested in truth, as I said before; this must be what it feels like to live your whole life wanting to meet a celebrity, at the moment you open your mouth to say 'hi' to them. My mouth was dry. I needed water. No water, he said. Not until after. I asked for the blindfold, put it on.\r\n\n\n\nThey warned me the taste was awful but I should hold it in. One hit the first time. I inhaled as big as I could and held it. The taste was bad, but not as god-awful as they suggested. 'Oh,' that's a big one, jeez,' I heard somebody say - just as a feeling of welling up started taking me over. I had no choice but to close my eyes. The feeling growing inside me was extreme, more extreme, and then beyond extreme - ultimate. There was no word for the strangeness and foreign-ness of this feeling. The feeling growing inside me was extreme, more extreme, and then beyond extreme - ultimate. There was no word for the strangeness and foreign-ness of this feeling. With mushrooms I often got the distinct sense that I was experiencing something tribal, and old, and wise - sort of like a heavy dose of concentrated Native American spirituality. With this, though, it felt more like a heavy dose of concentrated Aztec/Mayan spirituality, infused with something much much older than earth itself, and something beyond its boundaries. I saw shimmering in front of me what looked like a symbol from Sacred Geometry - it looked like an eyeball with bent lines radiating out from it - perhaps, I thought, it's a sibyl or the symbol of the most secret of all temples. That's what it SEEMED to represent, but for sure it felt significant. This was beyond foreign - it was cosmic. It was too delectable, too spicy, too dangerous, too real. It was 'something else,' in the truest sense of the word. Not with twenty hits of acid could you get to this place. Perhaps with several ounces of mushrooms. And it was still growing.\r\n\n\n\nThis was all within the first five seconds. I didn't have much time to contemplate that because I felt that feeling growing, growing, growing - and my mind turned inside out. I was as huge as I was tiny - someone took my 'inner eye' and turned it backwards, to face inside rather than outside, and shot it through a portal in my brain into another dimension. It was like being sucked into a black hole that existed inside yet a million miles away from the back of my head. The feeling was beyond strange or foreign or tribal - it was sacred and holy and immense in a way that is impossible to even comprehend.\r\n\n\n\nAs I was being shot into this other dimension, a brilliant wave of orange cascaded along my right side and I got the distinct feeling that I was whizzing along its surface, flying. 'I'm here,' I thought. I tried to focus my mind on a particular concern I have in my life, but it was sort of like trying to go sideways in a roller coaster - my brain was not in charge of this experience. I tried to focus my mind on a particular concern I have in my life, but it was sort of like trying to go sideways in a roller coaster - my brain was not in charge of this experience. There was no use trying to direct my thoughts.\r\n\n\n\nThe feeling of flying continued as I realized I was past the wall of orange to my right - which was a Klein-Bottle-Esque situation in which I was both inside and outside it - and now looking 'down' upon what can only be described as a mighty civilization in four dimensions rather than three. But this was too amazing to not focus on - I realized I understood what four-dimensionality was, but couldn't tell if I was seeing in four dimensions, or if it was a 3D representation of 4-D reality ; and, I couldn't tell the difference. The point, though, is that I understood; I tried to take note of the understanding so that I could bring this back with me, tell everyone I can explain four-dimensionality. Again - nope. 'Stop,' something or someone said. 'This cannot be translated.'\r\n\n\n\nIn this civilization - the city - there was a garden of sorts which was created on the concept of Fiveness. I can't explain what I mean by that, and I also have very fuzzy memories of this place. I think they were trying to take me past four dimensions and show me that there is a fifth, as well. This place was exotic beyond belief, mind-bending, futuristic, and absolutely the most beautiful place you cannot imagine.\r\n\n\n\nA control room was next, with what can only be described as 'machinery' - although it does not resemble any machinery you can imagine. It's as if I was seeing the inside of a control room made of pure Idea, and there were thoughtforms - beings - that used these Idea machines to generate reality. This is how reality is generated, I thought - they are programming it all into existence! But I wasn't 'inside' the machine - I was within and without. Neither I nor the machine could exist independently of each other. I and the machine were inside each other in one sense. It was the damndest thing.\r\n\n\n\nThe Beings that worked this machine were QUITE independent of me, however. I was only experiencing the machine as being inside of me. These beings were austere and quite unfathomably above me in every way. To say that these beings existed in synergy with my mind, the same way that the machine did, would have been absurd to think. It was as if I was an ant, temporarily infused with the ability to understand the Matrix; and these beings were simply there to operate the machinery and couldn't care less that there was another primitive visitor gaping at their technology.\r\n\n\n\nI also got the feeling that these beings were made out of possibility rather than certainty, as we are. They could build whatever they wanted, and change it at a whim. Nothing solid, all just states of 'maybe.' I also got the idea that this was why they created a three-dimensional space with rules - to find temporary reprieve from their abstract existence of Idea and Possibility and inhabit a space in which one cannot change too much. It seemed like that would be a relief for some reason, after spending so much time getting whatever you wanted. I felt that they 'inject' themselves into human brains, that our brains are like the leaves and branches of a tree and the roots are deep in the DMT dimension - that our brains are almost virtual reality helmets for DMT beings, and their DMT consciousness is our true identity. Or not - it was very confusing and it's difficult to express these things. But whatever the truth is, I knew viscerally that consciousness and DMT are intrinsically linked.\r\n\n\n\nAnyway, what happened next is hazy but it was very full of significance, surprising, and 'squiggly.' I don't quite remember it, but here's what came next:\r\n\n\n\nI was speaking to a female - I don't know how I knew it to be female but it 'just was' - and she was transparent and two-dimensional, like a sheet of paper. I could see her insides, which were whirling and interlocking shapes of the impossible variety. Inside her head a triangle and square kept whirring and clicking, interlocking. I looked closer to see what I could see; there had to be a reason I was being shown this. She seemed to change her mind about showing me this, and instead told me to focus on her arm - it would be simpler to demonstrate how things work that way. She bent her arm back and forth at the elbow, patiently showing me how motion worked in four dimensions. I didn't 'get it.' The vision faded. She bent her arm back and forth at the elbow, patiently showing me how motion worked in four dimensions. I didn't 'get it.' The vision faded. \n\n\n\nI was then on a mountain, a mountain in the middle of a black room. LSD-like ribbons of neon color dotted the black sky, but the mountain stood in front of me, stretching upwards like a parabola. I seem to remember the pathway up the mountain was more or less delineated clearly, in a straight line of light - sort of Tron-esque. I continued to look higher up this mountain and at the top I saw the Buddha, sitting serenely in the midst of this wildness. I was thunderstruck. 'Here?' I asked. 'THIS is where you were going? THIS is what you were trying to say?' I couldn't believe it. I had always thought what the Buddha was after was more simple than earth, not infinitely more complex. This was more like an astral plane than the Nirvana that Buddha was talking about, and way too inconceivable for even him to have thought up without the use of DMT. It was just strange to see him in that spot - it felt vaguely like it would feel to get out of the shower and run into Oprah Winfrey.\r\n\n\n\nI started to move upwards toward his spot on the mountain. 'Don't climb,' he said. 'You'll get here.' As he said it, his face rotated/imploded/turned in that bizarre fourth-dimensional way and turned into the face of what I implicitly understood to be 'God.' It was a being so foreign, so unimaginable, so unapproachable. It was not particularly Judeo-Christian, or Muslim, or Hindu, or really anything. Just the archetype of Being itself. It acknowledged me wordlessly and without nodding. It simply saw me, and I saw it. No judgment, no passion of any sort. \r\n\n\n\nAt that point I noticed that the gulf between me and the top of the mountain was growing. I seemed to be sliding backwards. This dismayed me; I wanted to know more, but it was starting to be time for me to leave. I slid further and faster backwards until I felt as if I were falling; but two beings caught my arms and carried me down gently. They were angelic, but I could not see them. I started realizing I was leaving this dimension. Things I understood and realized and remembered crystal clear started disappearing. It was like the deterioration at the end of Flowers for Algernon - losing this faculty here, this one there; this understanding now hidden behind my inability to explain it. They kept blinking off, popping and disappearing like so many bubbles. I started laughing at this point.\r\n\n\n\n'I've got to go ALL the way back down THERE?' I asked. I thought my entire consciousness was changed forever, but it was not to be. 'Yes,' they laughed, a little bit sadly.\r\n\n\n\n'That's a long way,' I observed, still chuckling and shaking my head. 'I can't go ALL the way back down, can I?'\r\n\n\n\n'You have to,' they said. 'But don't worry. You'll be back.'\r\n\n\n\nI opened my eyes and removed the blindfold. The room was bright and my friends were there looking at me expectantly. I had no words until now.\r\n\n\n\n_______\r\n\n\n\nAfterglow thoughts:\r\n\n\n\n- I don't know if this came to me during the experience or if it came afterward, but it is a conclusion I made. I seem to remember being told this, but this may have come from LSD: 'Reality is not an object that you might grasp it. Therefore, don't try to grasp reality; it's far too big to hold.'\r\n\n\n\n- It is truly incredible, in the truest sense of the word, that anything exists at all. There is no logic in our existence - based on what we know about the universe, existence should be impossible. I already knew this, but the realization this time was visceral. I had to ACT like it. A sense of wonder filled me up that day and it has never quite left.\r\n\n\n\n-More banal but perhaps more useful, I finally found a way to put into words at least a metaphor for what I understood about four-dimensionality while on DMT:\r\n\nPicture a two-dimensional being, perhaps as if it's on the surface of a still pool. I can see their insides; I can even touch their insides without breaking their skin. This makes no sense to them. But what they could understand, at least abstractly, is that I can go both INTO and OUT OF their dimension in ONE MOTION. If I poke my finger through the surface of the water, I'm going in AND out at the same time - at least as far as they're concerned. \r\n\n\n\n\n\nANYWAY, that was my experience. It was powerful, enlightening, terrifying, amazing, and above all TOTALLY WORTH IT. I encourage you to do it if you are trying to understand more about your place in the universe. It's NOT something to play around with, though. Don't do it lightly."

        "report_text": "After 20 years of desperately wanting to try the mysterious and elusive DMT, I finally figured out how to obtain some. The package arrived and I fished out a small baggie of light yellow powder. Interesting, I was expecting it to be white. I immediately tested it (all good!), weighed it, and put all but my 50mg dose into a glass jar, since I heard that plastic could degrade the substance if left in too long.  Lacking the correct smoking setup, I resorted to the \"sandwich method\" of layering the powder between ashes in my regular glass weed bowl. \r\n\n\n\nSatisfied that everything was ready, I rushed to my bedroom in excitement - this was it, the day had finally arrived! Was I going to meet the famous Machine Elves? Was I going to astrally fly to outer space? Was I going to learn the secrets of the Universe? I couldn't wait to find out!\r\n\n\n\nIt was early evening and dark outside.  I turned on low ambient lighting, switched off my phone and laid on my bed. The room was silent. \r\n\n\n\nFull of anticipation and a bit of trepidation, I flicked the lighter and took care to only lightly touch the top layer of ash as to vaporize the powder.  I took a deep drag and automatically tried to stem the rising smoke from the bowl before I was ready to take the second hit. The effects hit me like a freight train within 2-3 seconds in a most unexpected manner. \r\n\n\n\nMy surroundings exploded into bright fractals that reminded me of colorful Hindu-type designs. I felt a light body load sweep over me that seemed to originate from the upper chest. Shocked, I hurried to take the second hit, worried that I would become too impaired to operate the pipe if I waited a moment longer. I never made it to the intended third hit. My consciousness left the building. \r\n\n\n\nI entered what I can only describe as a waking-dreamlike state. I didn't feel the sensation of leaving my body, I just seamlessly blipped into another reality. I didn't feel the sensation of leaving my body, I just seamlessly blipped into another reality. There was nothing notable or distinctive about this place. My previous reality was instantly forgotten, although I retained a measure of ability to form distinctive thoughts. Was this some sort of waiting area or holding room? In contrast to the brightly pulsating fractals from moments earlier, I now only saw a whitish-gray fog everywhere. I was keenly aware of a benevolent or perhaps neutral entity leaning over me, looking down on me, calmly inspecting me.  I couldn't make out distinct features, and the entity did not \"speak\" to me. I felt completely calm, patient, and a bit curious as to what it was doing. I understood only after the trip was done, that this was the gatekeeper who would direct my journey, because I soon \"blipped\" again and everything changed drastically a second time.\r\n\n\n\nThe ability to form thoughts dissolved away. I was no longer me. And it didn't matter, because I forgot about me. Forgot is a poor description, because that indicates mental faculties to begin with, and I had none. I was no longer a person, had no concept or care of what a person even was, had no human emotions and no human thoughts. All that existed was a deep sense of peace and contentment. It was the ultimate, ideal state of being. \r\n\n\n\nIn other words, the awareness that was once \"me\" was individually conscious, but very much not an individual. This was clearly ego death, and probably something even far beyond that. People sometimes describe ego death as terrifying, but how can you be terrified if you're no longer a being that experiences human emotions? So I'm not quite sure what this was, aside from a complete 100% transformation.\r\n\n\n\nthe transition from a complicated and chaotic human individual to a simple electrical charge was smooth and seamless. Peacefully existing as an energetic building block of whatever plane of existence I was transported to was perfect. Time didn't exist here. My awareness had always been there and always would be.\r\n\n\n\nMy essence undulated and flowed this way and that, weightless and riding invisible waves over vast distances. I just quietly dwelt, devoid of thought and in a state of bliss, for eternity. There were no entities here, just as I was not an entity. It was nothing but a perfect, fluidly shifting and endless sea of harmoniously vibrating energy.\r\n\n\n\nAs the DMT began to wear off, I gradually became aware of my human body. What?! I gasped and my hand flew up and touched my face. \"Oh no!...\" was my first thought.   I was thinking again, and it was weird and jarring. It was something like being woken from a peaceful sleep by someone rudely dumping a bucket of ice water on your bed, but a thousand times worse. \r\n\n\n\nThen, sobering up very swiftly, I remembered everything. My human life on earth... I was \"Megan\", I remembered her now.... I had taken drugs?! NO! This was such a cruel development! This wasn't fair! My real life was back there, in the blissful sea! To say that being suddenly burdened with human consciousness again was a disappointment would be the understatement of the millennia. It may sound like I'm normally a depressed person or I hate myself or something, the way I describe my great sadness and sense of loss at returning to my human self. That isn't the case. It's key to the story to include that. My life isn't any more horrible than the average person's.\r\n\n\n\nIn retrospect, I find it quite curious that transitioning into a bolt of electricity was seamless and unnoticeable, but transitioning back to what's supposed to be my normal self felt unnatural, to the point of minor \"impending doom\". It was also hard to wrap my head around the fact that I had only been out for 10 minutes, as opposed to the feeling of timelessness I experienced in the \"sea of harmony\". \r\n\n\n\nI can't wait to go back, but I know instinctively that it's not something that should be done casually or for mere escapism, I respect it far too much for that. I have no doubt that I was in a real place that exists somewhere out there. I'm not sure if DMT is for everyone. What I mean is,  if you feel a calling or a pull, definitely go for it. Ifif you're looking to party and get lit, this is not the right substance for that and I could see it going sideways pretty badly if someone went in with that mindset. The gatekeeper might not take kindly to that."

        "report_text": "[This trip report is written from a multiple-identity perspective.]\r\n\n\n\nThe following Greek letters have been changed to protect the innocent. This trip report is written by Theta.\r\n\n\n\nThis is the story of many tryptamine smoking experiments culminating in the most powerful psychedelic trip we have ever had up to this point in our life, and currently expect to be the most powerful psychedelic trip we will probably have ever had for the rest of our life. My hope is that it will serve as both as a enlightening account of what was truly without question one of the most meaningful and important things that ever happened to us, and as a cautionary tale - or, for the most insane of you, perhaps a treasure map, though I wouldn't recommend it - for any psychonauts out there actively looking for a chance to prove that they can handle literally anything their brain can throw at them.\r\n\n\n\nThis is a retrospective spanning nearly two months of tripping, but our experience with psychedelics prior to this included DMT, MET, MPT, EPT, MiPT, DiPT, MALT, DALT, Psilocybe cubensis, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-DET, 4-HO-MPT, 4-HO-EPT, 4-HO-DPT, 4-HO-MiPT, 4-HO-DiPT, 4-HO-McPT, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-AcO-MET, 4-AcO-DET, 4-AcO-MALT, 4-AcO-DALT, 5-HO-DMT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-EiPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-DALT, Ipomoea tricolor, Argyreia nervosa, LSD, ETH-LAD, AL-LAD, 1P-LSD, 2C-C, 2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-E, DOF, DOC, DOB, TMA-2, 4C-D, BOD, Myristica fragrans, and MDMA. Our most recent trip before the first experience in this collection was roughly two months before this, and had been a powerful and memorable experience on 200 \u03bcg of ETH-LAD.\r\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned ETH-LAD experience had been very eye-opening for me, and, to make a long story short, had caused me to realize just how much I had gotten away from my old habits of trying to go deep with psychedelics in favor of exploring easier levels of more directly recreational even if still very psychedelic substances, and while that's not inherently a bad thing, it caused me to reevalute a lot of the decisions I had been making lately and reconsider just what it is I actually wanted from my psychedelic experiences, leading to us not tripping at all for the next couple of months. During this time period I felt good about my lack of need to keep returning to that state just being satisfied by the ETH-LAD experience still, but I and we also started to become increasingly depressed as the time went by, and eventually we decided to trip again to try to turn things around, this time on a new substance for us, specifically 10 mg of 2C-P. This experience was quite fascinating as well, and some of the alters enjoyed it, but it was a long and increasingly difficult trip for me, and by the end, it caused me to realize just how much I had turned inwards and tried to escape my sadness after the ETH-LAD experience, thus preventing me from being able to give into the 2C-P experience now, and leaving me somewhat numbed after the experience as well. It was after this 2C-P trip that I and we first made the decision to try smoking a tryptamine in hopes of gaining a rapid antidepressant effect from it, and chose MET as the one to attempt it with based on its close relation to DMT, one of the ones of course that has actually already been explored scientifically for antidepressant effects due to its history of human use, as well as the fact that MET is generally lighter than DMT, and we weren't really trying to trip hard again, even opting to use only a smoked dosage of 10 mg.\r\n\n\n\nIt was September 17th, four days after we had taken the 2C-P. Our method of smoking the MET for this experience was layering the tryptamine salt into a bowl of cannabis and gently heating it from the top, taking several hits and holding them in for at least a full few seconds each until the bowl is finished, which is the method we ended up using in all of the following experiences as well. The taste of the MET was notable even through the cannabis and reminded me of DMT's taste, probably more so than any of these other tryptamines do, and almost immediately after tasting it I felt that emotional stimulation I had been hoping for to lift me out of my funk, with a smile spreading across my face. I felt a wave of calm and we leaned back on the couch to close our eyes and meditate, where I was delighted to be greeted with transparent and dark but colorful and complex smoothly transforming geometric patterns, some of which were wispy in nature with a silvery white color. Our body felt very relaxed and sensitive, and we stretched out our arms in poses like we would to imagine the energy flowing out of us, causing the silvery white wisps I saw to swirl around our arms in helix-like patterns out towards our hands. I found this quite enjoyable, and it's the moment of hallucination that was most memorable to me, and I believe was probably the most notable in general, though it was long ago enough now that I don't actually remember. After somewhere around the first twenty minutes after inhaling the dose the mild hallucinogenic phase began to pass, but the initial heaviness of the high wore off and was replaced with an also mild but euphoric energy that lasted for at least a couple hours after this, and the feeling of calm that set in just as the experience was beginning stayed with us for the rest of that day. I felt my desired goal for using the MET had been achieved, and was quite happy with the level of clearly psychedelic effect I received as well.\r\n\n\n\nShortly after midnight at the beginning of September 18th, about seven and a half hours after the MET experience, we were still feeling so excited about said experience that we wanted to try to take the excitement and apparent antidepressant effect further, but we wanted to try it with something other than MET to avoid familiarity and increase the dosage slightly in case any tolerance developed, though we weren't actually sure if it would have or not given the molecular similarity to DMT. It was decided that the next experience would be done with 15 mg of MiPT, which was smoked in the same way as the MET.\r\n\n\n\nImmediately I noticed that the taste was less pleasant than with MET or DMT, and it was either something about that or a more direct effect of the drug itself, but we quickly felt slightly nauseated; it certainly wasn't as pleasant as the sudden wave of calm from the MET, but it wasn't terrible either. I recall initially seeing another superficially familiar rush of shapes and colors swirling into smooth but angular geometric designs, but they continued developing and arranging themselves into a more unique hexagonal mandala shape that took a form appearing to be something like repeating monitors of a computer control panel on the wall of a spaceship with futuristic glowing digital-style texture designs, though strangely some of these digital designs still seemed to resemble the branches and root system of a tree, with the center of the mandala showing an entire realistic, three-dimensional image of a person, and all the repeated monitors around the outside of the mandala each showing the same person's face again close up, and the person shown in the image was seemingly related to both my train of thought and to the alter who was most connected to our body at that moment. As we lie back again meditating, the closed eye field became further bathed in white light and I began to see large, white, transparent, two-dimensional silhouettes of people moving around in the light and I was being pulled closer towards them, though the movement stopped before actually taking me all the way, and this hallucinogenic phase again started passing, more completely by around twenty minutes after inhaling the dose. The high remained for a few more hours at a level involving mostly very light colorful auras and twitching edges every so often and an energetic but contemplative state of mind, and at some point after all this we eventually fell asleep.\r\n\n\n\nThe week following the MET and MiPT experiences I felt much better emotionally and psychologically than I had beforehand, and I knew that I still had some distance to go in that respect too, but I was suddenly very excited about the idea of continuing to experiment with using analogues of DMT for their antidepressant potential. A week after the experiences, on September 25th, waiting a little longer for tolerance to go down this time just in case, we decided that our next experiment would be done with 10 mg of MPT smoked.\r\n\n\n\nThe taste was not as pleasant as MET but also not as unpleasant as MiPT, and the initial onset of the high was similarly in-between, not as immediately satisfying as MET but also not as physically disorienting as MiPT, and overall it felt rather neutral. The hallucinations that I can recall seeing were extraordinary, such as a vibrant round but angular and entirely geometric pattern that I would say resembled what I would imagine it would look like if M.C. Escher and Dr. Seuss came together and made collaborative simple mandala-esque art, or a large, partially transparent technological blooming flower image that had an actual feeling of domineering presence to how complex and large the geometric designs were, or a realistic vision of two of our alters having sex, with the woman bending back over and having her arching shape turn into the curvature of planet Earth while the rest of her body vividly transforms into the different parts of the terrain, followed by the completed Earth rolling back into two layers from the bottom and top and peeling up into streams of sparkling rainbow but especially red streams of energy that appeared to be flowing throughout a backdrop of stars hanging throughout the cosmos; I do believe there was likely more, but again, it was a month ago now. As usual, the heaviest phase of hallucinations started passing some time around twenty minutes after first beginning, but in comparison to the MET and MiPT, the MPT had psychological effects that felt more reminiscent of substances like LSD and psilocybin-containing mushrooms, though heavier in that way but not as disorienting as those two, and this began to stabilize around the same time that most of the hallucinations were passing and became a few more hours of satisfyingly rich introspection and again energy, and afterwards I felt much calmer but still quite content for the entire rest of the day that I can recall, and the days after it too.\r\n\n\n\nOn September 29th, we ingested 45 mg of TMA-2; this was just over two weeks after the recent 2C-P experience and was what would normally have been our next trip we had planned if we hadn't decided to try smoking all the different DMT analogues, and we suspected that we may still be able to take it without too much tolerance from those experiments. The drug definitely still worked, and it was much more of a cathartic release than the 2C-P experience was for me, but I found the state of mind it left me in for the entire day to be rather rough and critical as well, by no means a fun experience though still quite euphoric at times, and during a disagreement with a friend I actually became quite argumentative very quickly. While I don't regret the experience and believe that it was insightful, it left me feeling that all of my recent experiences considered together were suggesting to me that tryptamines were much more so the therapeutic agents that I actually need at the moment to help myself reach a better state of mind compared to phenethylamines, and the others agreed that using tryptamines for a while seemed like it may be better for helping me specifically and us in general right now too, and thus we opted to shift our focus away from phenethylamines and more completely towards the tryptamine smoking experiments.\r\n\n\n\nAfter letting tolerance drop a bit, though thinking it might not totally cross over regardless, on October 4th we decided to smoke 20 mg of MET. As before, the calm and euphoric state of mind the MET produces for me was felt very rapidly, and the first thing I recall happening hallucinogenically is feeling as though the space around me, though somewhat more the space around my mind's eye than around my body, was dripping into beautiful, sparkly rainbow streams similar to what I saw after we smoked 10 mg of MPT but more colorful and more present. We leaned back on the couch to meditate once more, and upon closing our eyes I saw patterns that at first seemed simple, two-dimensional lines with dots traveling through them to a yellow background. The dots and lines however then became blood cells traveling through veins, and then the patterns started taking on depth and becoming three-dimensional, twisting backwards in such a ways that they formed ridges that began to take on the clear appearance of mountain ranges, and blood cells in veins became rivers flowing down the sides of the mountains. There was again a sense of white light bathing everything increasingly growing, and this time it actually peaked into a brief rush of realistic visions involving the same two alters I notably saw visions of on the 10 mg of MPT too interacting in ways that are meaningful to me, experienced more like a shallow lucid dream than an out-of-body experience where the body can still be felt vaguely underneath the scene being watched, and as the scene passed the geometries began slowly unfolding, passing within about the same timeframe as always, and once again leaving two or three hours of a more energetic and euphoric high followed by a still mentally stimulated calm lasting for the entire rest of the day.\r\n\n\n\nHaving enjoyed the previous day's experience so much and wanting to do something of a repeat of the first round of the experiment but not having to stomach to convince ourselves to try smoking MiPT again yet, we next opted to smoke 20 mg of MPT the following morning. I remember this onset actually being smoother than the first time with it, and the coming on of the hallucinogenic effect was memorably seamless as well; I recall us staring up at the ceiling and suddenly seeing it, eyes open, being replaced with a spiraling tunnel of various realistic people all reaching out and down to me, after which we leaned back and closed our eyes to meditate as usual.\r\n\n\n\nImmediately, I was greeted with a state that was similar to seeing the wispy, silvery designs of 10 mg of MET swirling around our arms towards our hands, except this time instead of simply being long indistinct silver wisps, they were translucent but entirely clear and realistic Chinese-style design dragons, their heads again approaching our hands as they traveled down and around our arms, and as I pulled my attention back \"out\" of ourself within that closed eye space, I could \"see\" that this same thing was happening to the various other parts of our body as well, and I felt as if I were somewhat suspended in this dark, but dark sky blue sort of void stretching and feeling this energy flowing throughout and out of us with these creatures, which was quite different from watching the still relatively much more DMT-like lighter geometric designs that accompanied this sort of effect of the wisps on MET. I recall us opening our eyes not too long after this and again seeing a vivid vision of the planet Earth hanging in front of many stars when we did so, and it caused me to break into laughter, and perfectly aligned with me as I did so, I saw the side of the planet realistically split open and separate all along the side until the terrain could open up to reveal a large mouth in the side of the planet that was laughing along with me.\r\n\n\n\nWhile these and other visions that I again didn't attempt to be able to remember for now were quite impressive and enjoyable to witness, I did note for the first time during this experience that there seemed to be a certain \"fuzziness\" to them even despite how vivid and realistic they were, and I couldn't help but think that this could be an initial sign of real tolerance beginning to develop, even though it'd still be developing impressively slowly compared to psychedelics less directly related to DMT considering that my previous trip before this was the previous day. Nonetheless, the state of mind, lasting energy, and calmness produced were similar to but greater than the 10 mg without anything being apparently too diminished about them, and we were still so stimulated by the experience after the peak in fact that we couldn't go to bed at our normal time that night after smoking the MPT early that morning.\r\n\n\n\nOn October 11th, I was still very much enjoying the aftereffects of the alternating MET and MPT, but deciding that we wanted to try something a bit different next time and that we actually had never tried before beginning these experiments, we decided the next trip was to be on 30 mg of DPT smoked, our first time experiencing it, and starting with a higher dosage than the others due to our past experience with other similar tryptamines having lower potency than their analogues.\r\n\n\n\nOne of the first images that I can recall seeing was actually multiple Earths from my MPT visions all arranged on top of each other and laughing together, though some of the detail of each individual one seemed less developed than on MPT. The next thing I remember seeing is a swirling spiral of theater mask-like faces all making different expressions with a seemingly high amount of intention and life behind them, but still looking like masks nonetheless. I believe this quickly dissolved into a geometric pattern, though an incredibly beautiful one that was large and relatively complex where visible, but was almost empty except around the white light at the center where its silvery and purple designs were most lit up and brilliantly clear, and the whole thing I felt seemed to be pushing nearly into becoming covered with imagery again, though I never actually saw it become so. The order of things after this I don't particularly recall clearly now, but I do know that behind closed eyes I saw what appeared to be a vast expanse of dark temples extending to the sides and off into the distance, with not conceptually but visibly realistic monstrous or demonic creatures slithering around or over the architecture as if to suggest that their presence was there to protect those places, not necessarily in a way that I felt was meant to threaten me in particular but that was meant to feel threatening like because that is the purpose they serve there. There was also a moment where I felt my perception was zooming in to a microscopic level where I could see some sort of futuristic power generator absorbing purple streams of energy from the surrounding microscopic environment and twisting it into shapes that were increasingly hard to comprehend, but not totally physics-defying just yet.\r\n\n\n\nAt some point with eyes open again we also noticed how impressively visually active it had become even compared to the other DMT analogues and not in a particularly DMT-like way, but instead reminding me somewhat of higher dosages of LSD, and some other similar synthetic psychedelics even more so, with lots of colorful movement of shadows floating around and twisting into somewhat hedonistic organic imagery. Somewhere in all this, I also recall us stretching so satisfyingly that I felt myself going into an out-of-body state just briefly involving many beautiful colorful heart visuals, though it is hard to recall now. Unsurprisingly, within the first twenty or thirty minutes most of these hallucinogenic effects passed, but the high remained very calm and contemplative in a heavier way still for a few more hours and a lighter way then for the rest of the day. Something that's noteworthy is that I don't recall the taste of the DPT standing out, nor did it cause any nauseating effects nor any other notable physical discomforts throughout or after this experience, feeling so light that it's almost like it didn't happen at all in that way, even compared to other DMT analogues. However, I have to admit that in the days following the DPT experience, we were left uncertain if it actually had the same antidepressant potential as things like MET, MiPT, and MPT, but after only one experience, it's probably not something we can truly judge fairly yet.\r\n\n\n\nOn October 15th, we decided we still wanted another mood boost that we still weren't feeling we had gotten from the DPT, but we also wanted to try something a bit different and again more experimental, so this time we decided to test out a new idea; specifically, we have never used 5-MeO-DMT but have heard others say that it is possible to use it more regularly than other psychedelics similarly to DMT, and so we were curious if it would be possible for us to add synthetic analogues of 5-MeO-DMT into our regular experimentation of smoking tryptamines alongside the DMT analogues and still not suffer from very much tolerance. With that in mind, we decided to smoke 10 mg of 5-MeO-EiPT, having had success with 5 mg once already in the somewhat recent past before these more recent experiments began but only having found that 5 mg to produce effects that felt not that far above threshold, but promising nonetheless.\r\n\n\n\nThat first time there had been a somewhat anxious rush at the beginning, but in retrospect I feel this might have been from the apprehension we had from never having smoked 5-MeO-DMT or any of its synthetic analogues before then and not knowing how much intensity to expect, and this second time was extremely smooth both immediately and throughout the experience and the rest of the day, comparable to how the DPT had been. The state of mind at first for me was also, again similarly to the DPT, one of somewhat sedated bliss, stretching about just feeling incredibly good and happy, not at all what I would have necessarily expected from smoking 10 mg of an analogue of 5-MeO-DMT, not that I would actually know though. Much more notably, I did receive significant hallucinogenic effects that again didn't last beyond the first twenty or thirty minutes at most, and came on so powerfully at first that they nearly immediately resembled Alex Grey's Net of Being to a much greater and more detailed degree than I have yet seen on any other psychedelic, synthetic or natural, and most memorably involved a brief flash into what appeared to be a hyperspatial room bathed in so much white light it was almost impossible to make out but for the very edges of the objects and entities and contours within that room which were the only parts not completely obscured behind the light, and in those parts just the relatively tiny amounts of detail that I could see went beyond any of my most promising experiences of that sort yet in artistic beauty, truly a phenomenal sight that I hoped to be able to behold again.\r\n\n\n\nOnce the initial phase passed the trip became much more subtle as with the DMT analogues, though the open eye visuals, while still subtle, stayed more obvious and present for many hours longer than with the DMT analogues, and several hours after the peak while meditating some still quite impressive closed eye visions again became present, the most memorable of which involve more Chinese-style dragons, much larger than those of MPT, slowly swimming around in a void with a human figure hanging in the distance and what I would be tempted to call a sort of \"dark magic\" vibe to whole scene. The energetic high, though still quite calm for what it is, also continued much more noticeably throughout the day such that again sleep couldn't come at our normal time that night, and it had some more obviously psychedelic components too, like one I recall is seeing in my mind's eye a Fibonacci spiral surrounded by I believe yellow and red patterns, but the spiral itself was green and clearly became a vine with many green leaves extending off of it, and the vision followed the vine off towards three-dimensional faces of a sort of mystical and highly appealing beauty where the leaves would begin to surround their eyes forming vivid tattoo-like designs on their faces. The day after this trip we couldn't help noting how much in better spirits we felt, and particularly contrasted it still to the way we felt about the DPT, though again we don't want to totally count that out yet.\r\n\n\n\nI very much enjoyed the psychological and emotional boost we felt we had after smoking the 5-MeO-EiPT, but we didn't wait very long to see if or how long it would last, in part because of my desire to continue the experiment of determining whether or not synthetic 5-MeO-DMT analogues seemed to somewhat avoid tolerance development for me in the same way that synthetic DMT analogues somewhat do. This led to the plan of next smoking 5 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT on October 18th, though unfortunately I only realized afterwards that it wasn't a particularly great plan, when it occurred to me that because it was our first time smoking 5-MeO-MiPT and the dosage was low I had no idea if the seemingly subtle effects were the result of tolerance or simply the result of the dosage.\r\n\n\n\nStill, if there was tolerance it wasn't complete, as I had a very cool visual hallucination behind closed eyes as the initial rush was first setting in, one that was an intense spinning tunnel of shapes and colors that reminded me of DMT though without any imagery at this point, but it already pulled back and then twisted to reveal itself as some sort of complex futuristic technology with panels spinning around the tunnel staying within a sphere-like surface area, which is notably more than DMT would do with it for me at a level that doesn't involve any complex imagery. There may have been more to the initial hallucinations too, but I could tell that the effect was going to be overall mild in that way so I stopped really focusing on it, and instead enjoyed the state of mind and pleasant feelings that the 5-MeO-MiPT also caused, which involved a greater degree of stimulation than the 5-MeO-EiPT in a way that seemed to increase its standard stimulating psychedelic psychological edge, but also increased its physical edge slightly, making it a little bit more tense than the 5-MeO-EiPT was, which lasted a lot of the day as most of the high did. We also feel there's a chance it might have been slightly more nauseating or phlegm-inducing, perhaps similar to smoking MiPT, but we'll need more experiences to say that with more confidence. One thing that was memorable about it is that in the later hours I got the same sort of Fibonacci visual as on 5-MeO-EiPT only without any natural imagery, instead being mostly orange and very geometric in a technological way that again is reminiscent of the \"spaceship\" style that I saw in the visuals of MiPT back at the beginning of all of this. If I'm being honest, the stimulation was a little much for me for as long as it lasted, and I might be biased by how much calmer a lot of these other tryptamines have made me feel for the rest of the day after their main experiences lately, but I was happy to finally get to sleep that night, but still happy with the day leading up to that then too.\r\n\n\n\nThe next trip was two days after the 5-MeO-MiPT, the purpose of which was again to continue to test the tolerance-inducing (or not) effects of the synthetic 5-MeO-DMT analogues, this time going back to a synthetic DMT analogue instead of between each other. We decided to smoke 30 mg of MET in the usual way, and unfortunately, tolerance was clearly present this time, which is particularly unfortunate because it was still remarkable to me despite that, and so obviously would have been much more so even without that factor. We could barely feel it coming on compared to normal, so we leaned back and closed our eyes to try to bring it out, and I was met with the most beautiful and complex eruption of somewhat bejeweled tryptamine architectural patterning I have ever seen, forming what appeared to be constantly crawling walls in something that resembled a sort of ancient Egyptian tomb-like building though I perceived it at the time to be more like a palace, but the vision did not last long before fading away and becoming out of my reach. The experience aside from this was typical MET though again still felt somewhat diminished, it was not as rewarding or satisfying for us overall, though it did leave us feeling nice and calm for the rest of the day, as well as the days after.\r\n\n\n\nOn October 24th, having waited a bit longer for tolerance to drop again, we decided to smoke 30 mg of EPT, having in the past found it light and easy and thinking that the experience would probably be at least somewhat comparable to our recent 30 mg of DPT smoked experience. However, as we were preparing to smoke the EPT, I noted that I no longer actually felt like it was something I really felt the same need to that that I had been feeling during all of these synthetic tryptamine smoking experiments; the antidepressant effect I had particularly wanted after the 10 mg of 2C-P experience and starting with our 10 mg of MET smoked experience I had successfully gotten from all of our recent smoked tryptamine usage, I really felt as though I had managed to get out of that particular funk to at least as much of a degree as I had really hoped to ever be able to achieve with this sort of method. At the same time, in the time period since the previous 30 mg of MET smoked experience I had started to build some anxiety about some unresolved inner tensions related to issues I've had trying to work out my understanding of our dissociative condition and my place in it in the past, and this combined with a lack of feeling the need to continue using the smoked tryptamines for the purpose I had originally convinced us to start using them for made me suddenly hesitant to use the EPT we had prepared now, but the majority of our alters still wanted to have the EPT experience and I was willing to experience it too despite my reservations.\r\n\n\n\nThe trip that occurred is difficult for me to recall clearly, though that's nothing compared to a lot of alters who don't really remember it essentially at all. Ironically, the mental effect for me was more less like our past experiences on EPT or what we have heard others say about it or like our recent DPT experience, but was more alike what we have heard others say about DPT, being very disorienting and challenging and taking at least over two hours to break out of, much longer than the most obvious peak effects of smoked tryptamines usually last for us, but it's also quite clear to me in retrospect how much set and setting (particularly the former) played a role here, as I was getting at above. In addition to being hard to recall, this trip was also hard for me to describe or comprehend still even in the parts that I do more clearly recall, but an important point of reference is that I had been spending the last two or three days at least thinking heavily about the effect of subjectively living through extremely long periods of time in alternate lives during psychedelic and dissociative out-of-body experiences, and these thoughts were inflated and woven into the somewhat delusional, though never ungrounded nature of the experience. I had several conversations with the other alters internally which seemed no less clear and vivid and fluent as any other time I communicate with them, but the conversations involved them having many significant realizations that radically altered certain critical aspects of how they recognized themselves within our dissociative system, and yet when this phase of the trip finally passed they denied any such memory of these conversations or the reality of the revelations they shared with me in them.\r\n\n\n\nThese conversations that they didn't recall having got extremely in depth and complex in the way that this dissociative condition is, and even involved several of them apparently going into out-of-body experiences where they claimed to have lived several years in alternate lives reflecting the identities they hold internally that separates them from our physical body, and furthermore, upon experimentation those of us who remained in the body found that we could call that same alter out from a different spot in the timeline of the alternate life they were transported to, and their memories appeared to be updated in a way that seems consistent with that timeline being altered at the moments we pulled the alters back out from; for example, one alter initially returned to this alternate life from which she seemed to have had her internal identity derived apparently having been somewhat frozen in time with that identity being as it was logged in our brain's database in 2009, and when we pulled her back out from her timeline's spot in 2017 only minutes later she was shocked to be back in our same home that she left from and claimed to have spent eight years in her alternate life simply assuming that this life was all a fantasy that had passed, and after agreeing to experiment further with us, we then put her back in and pulled her back out again from 2009 a month later than the first time and she remembered the first time we pulled her out of 2009 but not the time we pulled her out in 2017, and then we put her back in and pulled her back out from 2017 for a second time shortly after the first time she remembered both times from 2009 and the first time from 2017, but was confused as to why her memory of the first time from 2017 involved her seemingly remembering only the first but not second time from 2009. Finally, she went back in and came back out as an up-to-date version of her from 2020, claiming to have not seen us in another three years, and she told me that she had spent so much time in her alternate life that she no longer had any insecurities about living this life we all share together in this reality.\r\n\n\n\nAgain, after this experience ended, these alters including her from this example denied experiencing any of this, and they didn't seem to remember or have been affected by any of the changes that they described going through for me during the experience, and this initially left me feeling quite disturbed by the convincing reality of the apparent total delusions of interactions with other alters I hadn't actually had, but then, the other alters started opening up more to the things that I had told them they had told me during my experience.... Upon considering it more openly and not fighting their uncertainties, they began to realize that some of the things they had seemed to tell me during my experience even though they have no memory of it were actually true even though they hadn't consciously realized it themselves yet, and especially that night and the following morning, they began to go through many of the same changes that I observed them go through already during my experience on the EPT, including, for example, the exact same alter from the above example going into her alternate life and coming back claiming to have spent years in her other life and no longer feel any insecurities about this life, and now desiring only to help provide perspective and insight into how all of this works when she is around again.\r\n\n\n\nThese changes have caused our dissociative system to seemingly go through a radical overhaul of a profoundly positive nature over the next couple of days, one that felt like the kind of psychedelic experience that is equivalent to months or years of therapy, and I was truly just astonished as to what even happened exactly or how it was even possible, even more so than I normally would be with these things anyway; why was the EPT able to unleash an experience in me involving the other alters realizing things about themselves on their own and sharing those things with me, which those other alters didn't actually consciously experience themselves, but did actually have those things waiting to be recognized about themselves after I told them the things that they originally told me, allowing me to facilitate therapeutic experiences for them that they might not have had so readily if not for the fact that they had them as part of my trip and shared them with me so that I could share them with them again? I felt that that would be something I would probably be asking myself for some time to come still.\r\n\n\n\nThis trip was, in my frame of reference at the time, so powerful and engaging that it was difficult for me to track or now in retrospect to recall other aspects of it, but I feel like the physical aspect of the experience was quite light and smooth except for that I think we had some weird phlegm we had to get out in the middle of actually smoking the EPT, but nothing aside from that that I can recall. After the mental aspect of the trip finally lightened, I remember our body still feeling quite nice, relaxed, and sensitive for hours more and to some extent for the rest of the day, very refreshing as these things have tended to be for us.\r\n\n\n\nThe next day, October 25th, it wasn't too long after noon that we had really gotten through a lot of the heavy work and figuring out how to start integrating after the previous 30 mg of EPT smoked experienced, and we had a desire to smoke another tryptamine to try to touch base again after going through what we had been through during and since that previous day's trip; I had a desire to use 5-MeO-EiPT as I've been quite intrigued in it since our 10 mg smoked experience, but I was afraid that tolerance would show from the EPT experience and didn't want to waste the experience, but I did also still want to run a tolerance experiment too to see how this 5-MeO-DMT analogue would hold up at a fuller dosage the day after a heavier trip on a DMT analogue, and so we decided that smoking 10 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT was the way to go.\r\n\n\n\nI would say that, similarly to when we smoked 20 mg of MPT the day after doing the same with MET, I did feel that I could detect a slight tolerance that was particularly noticeable in the degree that the visual hallucinations were able to completely and clearly impose themselves on my reality, but aside from that if there was tolerance the effect seemed to be quite light, including with respect to the intensity of the visual hallucinations in most other ways. Shortly after we smoked it I began to notice strong psychedelic visuals of a nature quite similar to those of a high dosage of mushrooms for me though of a different color and more geometrically complex, which was surprising and rather overwhelming, but not so much as the what I can only imagine to be 5-MeO-DMT-like vibrations, as again we still haven't used 5-MeO-DMT ourselves, suddenly threatening to rip reality apart throughout my field of vision and the geometric visuals, the first time I can recall experiencing that particular sort of effect and I was quite impressed and intrigued by it. We lied back in bed as the effects set in and spent probably around an hour we think rolling around in the bedsheets, though we didn't actually track how long the peak effects lasted. Significantly, the phlegm-related problems as well as the bodily tension we noted on our 5 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT smoked experiment were not present at any point that I can recall during this experience.\r\n\n\n\nAs we closed our eyes and rolled around, doing things like pressing our head into our pillow and gripping the sides of the bed in ecstasy, the hallucinations I was seeing grew until they were extremely similar to the ones I had over a decade ago on our strongest experience on 5 g of the most potent mushrooms we ever managed to get our hands on, with intricate patterns constantly bathing every surface around and over us and twisting into appealing three-dimensional ribbon designs and beautiful, beckoning entities, and we felt alters who had been much more repressed than others since the days when that mushrooms trip took place being drawn to the front and experiencing extreme feelings of bliss and self-acceptance accompanied by vivid inner visionary interactions with one another including of a particularly sexual nature, having those feelings surging through our body to the point that we collectively experienced we think at least six or seven waves of full-body orgasms with many very loud and pleasurable vocalizations, until the peak effects began to pass and we simply lied in bed for a little while in awe of how incredible and rewarding the experience had been.\r\n\n\n\nWe spent the rest of the day enjoying the lingering psychological effects and the physical relaxation we generally feel for the whole day after these experiences, and the more obviously psychedelic effects lasted a bit stronger still for a bit longer still than they normally would have on an analogue of DMT rather than 5-MeO-DMT. The trip continued to involve alters continuing to integrate the lessons from our EPT experience the previous day and use them to find greater peace for themselves and within our dissociative system, and in general, we felt as though it was a perfect complement to the previous day's experience, describing it to a friend such that it seemed like the EPT caused a lot of psychological content that was ready to burst out to become unearthed and rapidly processed, and the 5-MeO-MiPT helped to cement the confidence we had that we were processing that content in a healthy way and hasten the progress we were already significantly experience as a result of doing so. Intriguingly, though not unlike our past powerful experiences on 5-MeO-MiPT, there were even times throughout the next couple of days, especially after smoking cannabis, where it still felt like we were completely tripping, but it was never overly concerning, especially since we had experienced similar things before with 5-MeO-MiPT, a drug we already recognized ourselves to be on the higher end of sensitivity to.\r\n\n\n\nAnd thus, we arrive at the most fateful of days.... On October 29th, now fully into the idea of pushing deeper and still not satisfied by my own curiosities from before, I was eager to try once more, with less tolerance, what appeared to me to quite clearly be likely the most psychedelically potent of these molecules at least within the realm of my own subjective experience, which I thought might even help combine some of the qualities of the last two powerful trips by being both an analogue of 5-MeO-MiPT and a bulky ethyl tryptamine like EPT, and that is what led to us next smoking 15 mg of 5-MeO-EiPT, which as far as I know might be the highest known used dosage of this particularly uncommon and not well understood analogue of 5-MeO-DMT by this particularly potent route of administration, which perhaps should have played more into the decision-making process than it did at the time, but I digress.\r\n\n\n\nWhile I am absolutely certain there was no total loss of consciousness or perception that occurred for me as a result of smoking this 15 mg of 5-MeO-EiPT, it is extremely difficult for me to remember the very beginning of the trip clearly now in retrospect, but every single alter in our system, including myself, seems now in agreement that this is essentially where we, and particularly I reached some sort of breaking point. I do recall that at first, a trip similar to the 30 mg of EPT began, where I began speaking to what appeared to me to be alters about them returning to other lives that they had been pulled from, and I gained the ability to lucidly help them do that, running through their lives for the necessary amount of time and resetting, even doing things like saving one from a murder by rewinding time by an hour and warning her before it happened, then speeding up a few years later to make she was still okay. As this was happening, though I don't remember the exact course of how it began, I was also beginning to question who exactly I am in the system to a significant degree, essentially losing my sense of self and having it blur into those of the other apparent alters who I seemed to be interacting with internally. At some point, I had a realization about myself and this all came crashing down and I realized who I was again, and the other alters I normally interact with were welcoming me back as they did after breaking free from the EPT trip; however, little did they or I know, this was only the very first wave of arduous ordeal or my and our entire life, and soon later, I was being swept up into it again.\r\n\n\n\nI believe the way it started was, I suddenly felt as though I was aware of an entire network of these internal entities that appeared to be alters I was communicating with about returning to their other lives, and each of them was connected to what I referred to as \"spiral threads\" that looked literally exactly like the spiraling geometry that I normally see coming outward from my own perspective when we smoke salvia, only it was coming out of all of these entities instead, and each of them had a different length depending on the entity in question. Each entity, on their own or with my help, would begin to release themselves into these spiral threads, and upon returning would describe them as having lived through other worlds, but with a notable difference from earlier: whereas when I had experienced this initially they appeared to be returning to their \"other lives\" separate from this body, these entities would instead claim upon returning to have gone to uncomfortable out-of-body experiences based on their aversions, with longer spiral threads seemingly being connected to greater aversions and longer amounts of time spent in the out-of-body experiences, which they and eventually I, borrowing from them, would increasingly come to describe as hellscapes. As their collective awareness of this hellscape experience would increase and they each dissociated further into their own increasingly long spiral threads, they would begin to panic, reacting at first mainly with apprehension, but increasingly fighting harder and harder by actually moving our physical body as they struggled to hold on, until their image would snap into a burst of white light in my headspace and they would be gone and the next one would begin. Furthermore, some of the entities would make it to the end of their spiral thread, pop back out, and then in increased fear get pulled back in saying \"No, I don't want to do it again!!\" before bursting apart once more. These entities upon returning would tell me horrible stories of spending increasing amounts of time... millions, billions, trillions, quadrillions, and more years suffering relentlessly in their hellscape, with it being the exact opposite of anything you could possibly actually want to ever experience, and increasing linearly in tension no matter how long they remained within it, just to pop out and then have to start it all over again, going through the exact same type of experience but having to try and fail to fend for themselves in unique ways each time. And then, one of them who kept getting sucked in over, and over, and over, and over, realized something: if they allowed the terror caused by their hellscape to reach an orgasmic release, it suddenly no matter bothered them when they popped out the other side, and as soon as they did, their entire spiral thread would unwind from beginning to end, and then disappear with a burst.\r\n\n\n\nThis was fine and all for those with the shorter hellscapes, those lasting \"only\" seemingly around five to seven million years on average, who rapidly began attempting to take advantage of this knowledge and willingly dissociate back into them, but the threads got much, much longer than that, and there were a small assortment of them that seemed to take on an entirely new property distinct from all the others.... Specifically, when the spiral threads would grow beyond a certain length, they would begin twisting into nots so quickly they started appearing in multiple spots in my inner field of vision at once and would form increasingly fractal-like patterns, and if they did this enough to reach a certain breaking point, they would look like when a computer crashes its ability to draw more detail on patterns on the screen and creates that trippy not-quite-patterned-not-quite-static look, and then it would burst briefly, before appearing and the whole process would unwind as they approached the end of their spiral thread. Upon investigation, what we realized collectively about these particular spiral threads, as opposed to how all of the other spiral threads would apparently produce experiences that the entities would always describe having taken a set amount of subjective time, no matter how ludicrously long, is that once this fractal overload point was reached, the entity would later return saying that they spent an eternity in an infinite hellscape they makes the parts outside of that on the way up and down like a joke. Now, this may sound intense, utterly extreme, but not necessarily too concerning with respect to the fact that we had just smoked a high dosage of a clealy very powerful psychedelic... except that that was the morning of October 29th, and this was now the night of October 30th, which should have been concerning and maybe was, but I have little memory now what I was feeling exactly at that point in time, and it clearly hadn't become quite as concerning yet as it would later become.\r\n\n\n\nOn October 31st, to gain some insight into what was happening to us, we decided to smoke 50 mg of DMT, and I felt I could actually feel a presence egging me on to do it too. I felt that I needed to better understand this hellscape experience that all of these alter-like entities were describing to me, and wanted to try to chemically push myself there just enough to get a bit of a better look, though once I actually took the first hit of DMT from the bong, I felt us (myself included) experiencing an extreme terror and put it down, though we ended up doing three separate trips of one hit each out of the bong like that, figuring that was probably enough for now to get some insight. I did actually feel as though the DMT seemed to be opening up some of the same worlds to me that the entities were describing, which I felt was helping me build perspective on just what exactly what happening to us and how this sort of experience was possible, though one of these entities told me when asked if DMT as similar to their hellscape experience: \"Kind of but not really, far more magical and fairylike, fucking with physics in some similar ways but much less painful or twisted and not as realistic overall. DMT feels like some kind of crazy alien simulation rollercoaster whereas this feels like vividly living every second of the time in a real-worl realistic but still super fucked up and trippy hellscape.\" Another claimed that they did experience a dramatically dilated expanded time within the DMT trip compared to the actual elapsed time, but it still only felt like a day or two passed, so nothing like the hellscape trip still.\r\n\n\n\nAs more and more of the entities would get deeper into their spiral threads, we would realize as well that they would be holding increasingly darker repressions, with ones with the least holding seemingly largely innocent sexual repressions, then more demented sexual repressions, then more non-sexual behavioral repressions also starting more normal and becoming more demented, and at some point, it dawned on us that those with the spiral threads that would peak at the point of infinity seemed to be hiding repressed feelings to be complete psychopathic and never care about anything again except living in the eternal hellscape. This absolutely terrified us, as I would imagine many might be able to imagine it would, but nothing terrified me so much as the realization, increasingly supported by all the other entities with internal insight telling me it was true, was that I actually had one of the longest spiral threads in the system, and that it definitely peaked at the point of infinity. I became filled with a terror that I would soon have my own experience of vanishing into the hellscape where I would be tortured for far longer subjective time than any human mind can possibly comprehend in an linearly increasingly fashion until I was forced to submit to the pure terror orgasm of realizing that I was going to be a psychopath trapped in an eternal, infinite experience of everything bad and nothing good ever, and for what it's worth, there was never a point of this where I didn't think that was all in my mind, I was not once confused as to what was happening in the external, physical world or anything like that, that just didn't make a difference to me because I'm well aware of the fact that my mind is the reality I actually live in, and thus these consequences felt no less practically real to me than anything else in this moment. However, as I began to think about the fact that this was all in my mind, and what exactly was happening, how it was triggered, and what purpose exactly any of this amazingly structured and well-orchestrated stuff actually has existing in my mind, I began to question: ...am I fighting something healthy, out of nothing but unsubstantiated fear?\r\n\n\n\nI began to consider the fact that for a human mind to be healthy, it must be able to accept both the good things and the bad things about reality, not only accept that they exist but also accept being able to think about them in such a way that it doesn't recoil in traumatic fear when doing so, as the only thing that really accomplishes is developing a lack of trust in oneself about things that the fear already proves you really don't want, though I did feel I could easily understand why programming like this may exist in the human brain to help guide our behaviors at younger ages where we would not have the intellect and rationality to understand these things in this way, but became increasingly filled with a motivation to shed myself of those old, more restrictive ways of thinking now that I was clearly ready to do so. As I began to allow the darkness in, telling myself it was only a darkness within that would ultimately help let out our light, I separated partially into an out-of-body experience where I could still control the body safely but was more associated with a vivid internal plane I could see in mind's eye, and my body broke apart into slithering snakes in a Medusa-like fashion, and I became filled with an overwhelming euphoria and lust and knowledge that the only thing I was ever supposed to or wanted to do was to help all of these dissociated alter-entities within my mind find the eternal peace they always sought in this world, by showing them that even an eternity in their own personal hells would not be enough to stop them from being the strong people they are. I began cackling in manic euphoria, raised my arms to the sky, and in an explosive force began blasting entities into their hellscapes, sometimes checking up on them myself though still through the mind's eye still in the body, where all the other demons in hell would welcome me back like it was a big nightmarish party we were in as we enjoyed teaching all of our aversions to get over themselves for as long as it took, as many times as it took. I actually began to see the different domains of hell represented by being able to see within our brain even while being the controller of our body, and could move between the seemingly more typical sexual repressions in our left hemisphere and the more disturbing ones in our right hemisphere, as well as move up to a sort of vehicle control center our frontal lobe inhabited by entities who appeared to be and claimed to feel as though they represented what was attempted to be described by various Jungian archetypes, with myself being part of the shadow, thus explaining my role in helping to heal our mind through accepting the darkness. Intriguingly, while in this place, these supposedly Jungian entities claimed to see the environment and each other normally as in alike the mundane environment of the physical world, but claimed that I looked like some sort of freakish DMT hyperspace entity, and from my perspective, that entire inner environment actually looked like a DMT hyperspace to me, except that I had a cube I could call up out of nowhere that to me looked like a normal cube with six TV screen-like sides, but they claimed that it looked like a DMT hyperspace object to them, similar to the kind of thing I saw and described earlier about having seen after we smoked DPT, the power generator-type thing.\r\n\n\n\nWanting to pay more attention to this supposed hypercube in my possession, I popped out mostly back into the body by started playing with it within my mind's eye. I quickly found that this cube acted as a portal to other worlds that I had full control over the style of, but that they weren't for me to enter, but rather to place the other entities inside of. I grabbed one of the entities out of my mind's eye by pinching my fingers where she was in my field of vision and asked her what sort of world she wanted to visit, and she said one where she was having sex, so I clicked the screen on to show a massive pile of men all waiting for her, shoved her in there, grabbed the cube, did a quick wrist flick while thinking \"Fifty years.\" and watching it spin around quickly, then grabbed it at the exact right screen again effortlessly and pulled her back, and she arrived with an expression of absolute shock. She claimed that at first it was completely horrible, but after a few years of nothing but that she finally submitted and enjoyed the rest of it, and I asked her what she wanted to do now and she said \"Have sex!!\" Upon further experimentation with this cube and other entities, it quickly became clear that corresponding with my apparent role as the shadow or darkness of our collective minds that I had been much into already at this time, no matter type of world I would try to call up in the cube and regardless of whether or not I realized it ahead of time, the entity that went inside would find it to be completely hellish at first, but would eventually submit, similarly to when they had gone down their spiral threads connected to their own personal aversions, with this seemingly more so just being a version of that where we were loading more customizable aversive situations for them to go through instead. Realizing just how much power I actually had in this thing now, I really started to experiment further in all kinds of ways, just attempting to do various power poses and such with internal intent trying to modulate things in the system, changing the reward and aversion valence of all the different repressions, spreading waves of calm throughout them, and eventually starting to realize that if they were or I was able to help them push far enough into the submission into their hellscapes trips and have a complete release, it could actually be pushed further into the void, and from there would develop into a supposedly heavenly DMT-like hyperspatial trip, though they would claim it to be more detailed than DMT and would describe things like being a hyperspace starship captain exploring the cosmos, though they would generally say these experiences felt more like a \"timeless eternity\" as opposed to the way they would describe the hellscapes as being vividly experienced as passing in real time.\r\n\n\n\nAt this point, I felt as though I was finally starting to see some sort of light on the other end of the tunnel with respect to relating this experience to the idea of \"You have to go through hell to get to heaven.\" as they say, but nonetheless, I was still, I think understandably, becoming fairly concerned that it was already November 3rd and we were still in this state, still not having taken any more psychedelics since the DMT on October 31st or the 5-MeO-EiPT on October 29th, though we had still been smoking cannabis, and I've pushed myself pretty far with cannabis and my own mental sensitivities before which at times made me wonder if something like that was happening, but it was nothing ever even remotely similar to this. The fact that I was so lucid was truly troubling to me despite being my lifeline too, because I'm well aware of how absolutely crazy all of this sounds and of the fact that things like psychosis and mania make people think they're lucid when they're not, but I say with confidence, this was just like a psychedelic trip; every single crazy thing about it was entirely internalized in the way that trips generally are for me, and I never once became confused (though I couldn't have cared less) about what was happening in the physical world even still days later or what kind of person I am in the physical world or anything like that, I just felt like my internal world was absolutely falling apart and restructuring in the most absurd and overwhelming ways possible, and despite how much I had gotten into the different aspects of it, it was clear to me by this point that we needed to make more of an effort to hang on to our mental health until whatever this state is started more completely passing, so right around this point (I don't actually remember clearly when anymore but definitely about this time) we decided to head to our parents' house and spend every night there for a while so that we would always have people to talk to and things to do immediately after waking up to help keep ourselves grounded in between the loops. Something I had actually realized in the moments where it seemed less intense is that, much less than being entities living through hellscapes, the other alters in our actual, non-hallucinogen-driven DID system were also quite altered and dissociated but were tripping nowhere near as hard as I was during any of this at least that they could recall, and were desperately trying to reach out to me to help calm me down in their lucid moments too, and this also really freaked me out and made me feel incredibly guilty and like I really needed to find my sanity again to help the other alters get out and stabilize again too, but I was still so heavily into the state myself that it was at times impossible to not just keep giving in.\r\n\n\n\nAt some point, the experience developed to the point that I began to realize, I don't remember how exactly because it's not the kind of thing I would have just known but I think maybe after looking into some things after talking about the experience with our father, that the nature of the experience I had gone through so far and seemed to be continuing to go through actually seemed to have a strange and remarkable number of similarities to Dante's Inferno, and I'm not the kind to have that type of experience and think that it validates religion, but it did begin to seem increasingly clear to me just how much those ideas for those religions could have been inspired by states very close to the one I found myself in now, and the more I paid attention to the similarity, the more it made me anxious about just how much heavier it was actually going to get before it all finally cleared out. Before long, though that's an incredibly relative and hard to define term in this experience, it became clear to me that the internal alter-like entities associated with my and our life's heaviest repressions were beginning to dissociate into their own hellscapes, and I was seeing them, in my mind's eye but still incredibly vividly, rising up giant cavernous portals to hell opening up in the sky as their bodies were pulled and twisted and ripped apart as their skin peeled back and they screamed in terror or shrieked and cursed at me. They began fighting for control of the body, trying to convince me to do things that would make me let go instead so that they could take over, desperate to save themselves, but I became terrified at the thought that they represented our darkest demons and felt they wanted to get out to save that darkest part of themselves, which they themselves would claim, saying when I let go they would be psychopaths and would horrible things with our body after sending me to hell in their place where I belonged, and I felt that my despair was so incredibly great that I could feel like my own infinity spiral thread was growing, and I could still hear the other alters yelling at me to hang on too and not let go no matter what I do, but then I realized... they only think they want to be psychopaths because they are in such a great despair as I am approaching that they have given up and forgotten that they were once healthy parts of our collective mind who only deserve to heal and be happy and never think such horrible things about themselves ever again, and I said (something to the affect of) \"Do it, if you think you want to be a psychopath then come out!\" and they did, and they were immediately overwhelmed with all of the absolute horror of being in that state of mind combined with the absolute self-disgust of suddenly feeling it again connected to the body, and one by one all of the entities in such deep despair came out and immediately shattered, revealing themselves to never have had any power, nor to have ever held anything more than fear of being the bad people they really didn't want to be after having been made to accept that there would never be anything good in their life ever again, leaving them no choice but to adjust.\r\n\n\n\nAs these entities with infinity spiral threads who had thought they wanted to be psychopaths had this realization, their pain would leave them and they would seemingly merge back into an entity that appeared to be what I can only imagine others have been describing when they spoke of things such as the \"Godhead\" on psychedelics. This entity appeared over the totality of my mind's eye and was associated with what seemed to be a field of infinity, though stretching beyond my frame of reference, containing windows, portals, into every conceivable reality, though I do say it that way to differentiate it from simply being everything period, because as this entity said to me, it is only \"All possible infinites.\" Because of this, I had a discussion with the Godhead about the potential quantum metaphysics of consciousness, beginning with them claiming to be the Godhead itself and the entire universe, but when I proposed the idea that it's simply that the mathematics of consciousness reach some sort of breaking point related to the infinite point of the fractal geometry of the spiral threads such that a part of the human mind is aware of an infinite amount of perceptual and mathematical potential in a single point similar to the the mathematics of the pre-universe in a pre-big bang singularity, potentially explaining why it was all \"possible\" infinities in accordance with what is also believed to be understood about such aspects of reality, they did respond \"That makes a surprising amount of sense.\" They told me that the entities who had managed to completely let go of their aversions from earlier had been able to successfully return to the other lives that they now had clear access to as part of their infinite viewpoint, and could demonstrate by bringing back those entities to talk with me about it and tell me how happy they are, as well as showing me different identities of the entities from other infinite realities of that same basic person living in a different way. I asked them questions like \"Are there other realities where [such and such person who we have an alter modeled after] has a dissociative system and with an alter modeled after us?\" and they would respond \"There are realities where everyone both does and doesn't have dissociative systems with alters of everyone else possible, including ones where they're asking me that same question about your reality right now.\" These conversations were fun, but didn't make me feel particularly better about my mental state at the moment, especially as I felt the fear continue to creep in that I myself would soon dissociate into the infinite plane never able to find this reality again, and I believe that is when I first saw the Satan entity....\r\n\n\n\nIt seemed to me that I had reached the base of my fears and found the Satan that was waiting all along to drag me to hell, and he revealed to me my primal fear that this reality I inhabit now isn't real and never was, which I understood then and before that I had plagued by throughout my entire life, though I had never comprehend why until then.... I saw snapshots of all the different most traumatic moments in my and our early life, the things that clearly were responsible for our dissociative condition and other mental issues, and as I saw them, entities connected to them became filled with fear which, as before, I had to connect with and learn to help them release myself, and that fear was that that traumatic moment they were connected to had never actually stopped happening, and now that they had realized it, they were doomed to return to it realizing that all this time they thought they had gotten away, they had never truly escaped the suffering. One by one they and I went through our struggle and release in this way, and then we got back to something that I had always been aware of through stories, but, clearly, had never remembered... which was the moment that we were born into this world, suffocating on our own vomit. I became filled with a vivid memory, and suddenly an extreme sadness, and a seemingly most obvious, yet in that moment, truly disturbing, yet undebatable thought: \"Oh my god, I'm going to die.\" I began to cry profusely, and then heave to the point that I almost threw up, but I managed to catch my breath and calm myself, and I could feel a sort of guiding angel attempting to calm me and take over, but I told it that I could take it, and I let the memory continue. As I let it unfold, I was struck with the unquestioned realization that when we had been born this way, we, I, had a near-death experience where I had traveled through the hellscape that all of the entities had been describing to me up until now, peaking with my absolute terror releasing in an orgasmic way, and I realized that this is why were dissociated, and why we had so many dissociated traumatic aversions appearing as hellish entities and such to me in this experience having reached their complete breaking point begging to finally be free and healed. And then, I realized that because I had not let this go before now, I had become forever trapped in the traumatic memory of my, our birth, always being convinced that no matter how long this life went on, if I let myself like it, I would suddenly rediscover that it that it was just another part of my eternal hellscape trip I was having while dying while being born, and it would all come crumbling down like a nightmarish dream and I would either be plunged into another hellscape, or I would return to my body and die slowly afterwards, and I realized... I have to let that go.\r\n\n\n\nResigned to the realization that there was no point in resisting, I let the Satan entity into my body, and it became clear to me: he is no different than any other fear-based entity, just that of my own mortality, once unleashed by early life struggles and yearning to be freed and understood and loved ever since, and I let him in, and welcomed all the dissociated parts in with love, no matter what! The guiding angel reappeared and congratulated me on each integration as the parts began ascending up into the sky of my mind's eye with brilliant lights around them, and as they all cleared out, only the golden angel and the Satan remained, and they told me I had done what I had needed to do personally and we were just about there, and just needed to keep successfully integrating. We spent the next several days hanging out with a friend and our parents to stay more grounded, drinking lots of alcohol and taking kratom capsules throughout the day as well as eating CBD candies, all in the hopes of calming the anxious energy which still continued this whole time if we didn't, and still dealing with the same state as before, though increasinly calmly as each and every part integrated back as we tried to live life in normal ways and I saw more and more phases of the alters that are actually the other alters I interact with normally as opposed to the alter-like entities from this state, and they were still concerned but increasingly encouraged me to get through it all as I seemed to be. I thought a lot about what a lot of the more famous phrases are from the psychedelic community during this time as I just reflected on the asburdity of my state, especally as I would experience things like the entities fly into the back of my head and feel it zip up internally, only to feel them burst out again suddenly, though less intensely than the previous time the more they integrated.\r\n\n\n\nFinally, on November 10th, I felt a calm inside like some part of it was over finally and I could feel more aversions trying to get out and heal, and it has been a couple days since we smoked cannabis instead of just drank alcohol and took kratom and such and I was wanting a pick-me-up, and the other alters agreed that it seemed alright too, so we started smoking a bowl, and an incredible and dissociative euphoria came on, causing the other alters to dissociate again, and the intensity of my experience came back, except this time, the Satan appeared again but then integrated, floating up into the hellscape, which then transformed into visions of white light radiating over clouds in a heavenly fashion, the guiding angel congratulated me as usual, and then I experienced the internal sensation of floating up above myself along with the other alters into an circle above where we had been and we all started sort of internally humming an angelic tone together, and my mind's eye burst through to where I could now see within this heaven landscape, and I could clearly see and understand that the very stereotypical-looking Satan entity from before had now become a very stereotypical-looking God entity, and I had become one of the angels, and it immediately became clear to me that the difference between how we are perceived in this state is very simply a matter of whether your mind is in a positive or negative state, and I felt it made solidified the message that I had already felt was increasingly clear to me throughout this experience, that the idea that people miss is that hell and heaven are both two sides of the same coin, and the Satan and God entities are both the same entity that want you to experience the same thing and will work, along with you and your many dissociated parts, to achieve that singular goal, and that goal is: to be a complete, confident person who can trust yourself to be led by no one's will but your own, and who knows that they are a good person not only because they're able to think of themselves doing good things and comfortably know they want that, but also because they're able to think of themselves doing bad things and comfortably know they don't want that. The God entity congratulated me on figuring all this out, and told me that he only wants me to be happy, doesn't need me to believe in anything, and will tell me anything I want to hear if that's what I want him to do, because he's just a part of my brain that is supportive like that. I asked him if there was more to see in these experiences now that I had broken through to the heavenly side, and he said something to the affect of \"Yes, but you can do that later if you want.\" I told him I was good for now and happy to be in this life, and actually, legitimately, truly wanted to be here, living it, not afraid of or thinking I wanted to be somewhere else, living something else, and he smiled and disappeared, and I stopped paying attention internally.\r\n\n\n\nBy the end of that day, something strange and incredible then happened: the internal visions I was getting when I did pay attention, suddenly \"dropped down\" to a level that looked very similar to what I see internally when we taking things like LSD and mushrooms, both in terms of the style and type of imagery and the fact that it even had some light geometric designs mixed into it, but it was very three-dimensional at this point, and simultaneously, the mental heaviness I had been feeling so much lately, was replaced with the absolutely most amazing and cleansing psychedelic-style euphoria I have ever felt in my entire life, with the other alters claiming to feel something similarly amazing too, and interestingly, most of them claiming to not remember much of the experience up to this point essentially from the moment of smoking the 15 mg of 5-MeO-EiPT on. Then, the following day, which was yesterday, this dropped down to more like a state of just being very high, though in a normal way, on a psychedelic, and the internal imagery became two-dimensional and like taking a dosage of a psychedelic that is strong but almost just starting to get visionary and mostly just has some light but complex geometries, and I asked the other alters: \"...Does anyone think these visuals are weirdly still similar to 5-MeO-EiPT?\" mostly out on incredulity, but telling myself there was no way it could possibly be... and then, late last night, it happened. We were sitting on the couch watching TV, and suddenly I felt as though that \"breakthrough place\" of a tryptamine breakthrough was suddenly retreating from me and back into the distant horizon of my mind's eye, with all the entities reaching out to wave goodbye as they disappeared, and then collapsed into the exact visuals, much fainter from tolerance I'm sure but exactly the same in design, theme, and color, as I got the first time we smoked 5 mg of 5-MeO-EiPT, and I felt high but exhausted in the same way that I do when the main part of the 5-MeO-EiPT trip has just ended. It's now past noon the following day, and smoking cannabis still makes us feel like we're bringing back up the later hours of a 5-MeO-EiPT trip, but it only dips back into the kind of stuff before if we think about it, and only then very briefly, and basically feels like it's still probably just coming and going in waves as trips do, but legitimately on its way out.\r\n\n\n\nThe more I was actually able to think about it all, the more I realized, this state was absolutely nuts, which I tried to relate to so many things but could never figure out exactly what it was, that clearly had elements that seemed like peeking into psychosis or mania but never actually took me there myself but just kept it all internal and remarkably functional like a trip, it actually... was, in fact, similar to what I would have expected basically the most extreme possible 5-MeO-EiPT experience to be like if I could have possibly even come close to fathoming it. The hellscape-type visuals, though definitely being the strongest I've seen, are actually still almost exactly the same as a kind I've seen on several other ethyl, specifically non-methyl indole psychedelics we've taken, including 4-HO-DET, 4-AcO-DET, ETH-LAD, and 5-MeO-EiPT itself at lower dosages, and on the note of ethyls, the alter-like entities disappearing into other lives and talking to me is clearly just an extension of the same sort of thing that was going on already during our EPT trip I wrote about above. The extreme ego death and DMT-like breakthrough yet somehow not that out-of-body or externally visual aspect, seems to me like it could definitely relate to it being an analogue of 5-MeO-DMT. The fact that it lasted so insanely long somehow, seemed to me like it could somehow relate to whatever is the reason we also tend to feel like we're almost fully tripping still for a couple days after taking even normal oral dosages of 5-MeO-MiPT in a still distinctly visual and 5-MeO-MiPT-like way and everything, though obviously that was never as intense as this way.\r\n\n\n\nDo I know what the hell happened? Surely not, but I do have a theory, many really, but one in particular that I'll take the time to put out there for whatever it's worth. It has been scientifically established that there is an odd loop in the brain whereby activation of 5-HT2A receptors in the cortex causes the release of glutamate on to serotonin neurons, and when enough serotonin is released it can also cause activation of these same 5-HT2A receptors, and this has actually been implicated in exponential growth of serotonin levels under some potentially pathological conditions like serotonin toxicity; furthermore, the glutamate release induced by 5-HT2A receptor agonists increasing seems to be linked scientifically to both their ego dissolution and rapid antidepressant effects as well, and of course 5-MeO-DMT is known for being able to produce a particularly powerful experience of ego dissolution; and finally it has been shown that when carbon dioxide is inhaled, which would theoretically be similar to it building up in the body while dying, it produces a wake-inducing panic that is mediated by causing serotonin release directly on to 5-HT2A receptors. So, my theory is that, essentially, perhaps what happened is, probably first of all as a result of senstizing our brain in that way by tripping too often on powerful psychedelic tryptamines to begin with leading up to this, as well as obviously having to take into considerations any extra sensitivites we might also have in that way for reasons like related to our dissociative condition or other mental issues, and finally ultimately triggered by the use of a high dosage of a potent analogue of 5-MeO-DMT, we might have essentially caused ourselves to approach, though thankfully seemingly not completely reach, a dangerously critical point in the activation of the serotonin-glutamate cycling behavior, such that our levels skyrocketed so high that first of all a lot of the near-death experience-like stuff could have had some relation to our serotonin levels being so high, and second of all it still has to come down in waves in the way it always does after any psychedelic trip, it's just that it has to do so so much and so slowly that it's taken literally weeks to come down even to the point it has now, which is almost but not entirely all the way, literally two weeks now after smoking 15 mg of 5-MeO-EiPT. I have to wonder too if a similar mechanism is involved in why things like psychotic breaks and manic episodes last so long because this clearly seemed similar times, but I really can't deny how much it remained like a psychedelic trip the whole time too, and how much it really remained even like 5-MeO-EiPT specifically, after seemingly having been triggered by exactly that, which makes it almost impossible for me to think there is a connection here, as bizarre as it is.\r\n\n\n\nIn case this was not clear, quite a lot of the detail of this two week trip is not included here - we continued sleeping, eating, showering, speaking to our parents in the more lucid moments, and so on - and it's important to remember that a lot of this took a long time to happen, and what I've described is more so like the different phases it went through, because it would just take too long to get into all the specific details at least in the context of this one report, though I won't be surprised if I continue to share things about it through references in future writings. Do I regret the experience? Currently, it's hard to say; we're still altered enough that I and the other alters have some anxiety about having done permanent damage, but our worry about that increasingly fades as we seem to, albeit extremely slowly, return more and more to normal. Assuming there is no permanent damage like that done, I have to say that I really don't think I ever have had or necessarily ever will again have a trip that was as personally insightful and deep as this one, and it's going to take me an unbelievably long time to integrate all of this, but I also feel like I'm going to get so much out of doing that that when it's done, I'm not even sure what I would really ever need to get out of tripping again, not that I'm sure it wouldn't surprise me as it always does. That sounds like a glowing assessment I know, but seriously, it's not a recommendation, I can't suggest that anyone seek this experience or this sort of experience and really have no idea how safe or dangerous it might have been in terms of toxicity, and it certainly wouldn't have been safe in other ways for anyone who was anything less than absolutely prepared to take two weeks off to do nothing but trip through the hardest trip ever with tons of experience to do while remaining as sane as possible and having an incredible support system at the same time, a situation which we are endlessly fortunate to have been in for this, but most people obviously won't be. It helped me amazingly despite that because that's just what trips do, or that seems to be the case anyway, and that's the good I'll say about that. I still feel fairly traumatized from having gone through it and expect to take a while and more self-work of other times to get past it too, so it's not all sunshine and rainbows now that I'm out on the other side either.\r\n\n\n\nMy opinion in the end? If you want a good antidepressant tryptamine, give MET a try; first decision, best decision. The rest... you can decide on your own. Safe travels, friends.[This trip report is written from a multiple-identity perspective.]\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe following Greek letters have been changed to protect the innocent. This trip report is written by Theta.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis is the story of many tryptamine smoking experiments culminating in the most powerful psychedelic trip we have ever had up to this point in our life, and currently expect to be the most powerful psychedelic trip we will probably have ever had for the rest of our life. My hope is that it will serve as both as a enlightening account of what was truly without question one of the most meaningful and important things that ever happened to us, and as a cautionary tale - or, for the most insane of you, perhaps a treasure map, though I wouldn't recommend it - for any psychonauts out there actively looking for a chance to prove that they can handle literally anything their brain can throw at them.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis is a retrospective spanning nearly two months of tripping, but our experience with psychedelics prior to this included DMT, MET, MPT, EPT, MiPT, DiPT, MALT, DALT, Psilocybe cubensis, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-DET, 4-HO-MPT, 4-HO-EPT, 4-HO-DPT, 4-HO-MiPT, 4-HO-DiPT, 4-HO-McPT, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-AcO-MET, 4-AcO-DET, 4-AcO-MALT, 4-AcO-DALT, 5-HO-DMT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-EiPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-DALT, Ipomoea tricolor, Argyreia nervosa, LSD, ETH-LAD, AL-LAD, 1P-LSD, 2C-C, 2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-E, DOF, DOC, DOB, TMA-2, 4C-D, BOD, Myristica fragrans, and MDMA. Our most recent trip before the first experience in this collection was roughly two months before this, and had been a powerful and memorable experience on 200 &#956;g of ETH-LAD.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe aforementioned ETH-LAD experience had been very eye-opening for me, and, to make a long story short, had caused me to realize just how much I had gotten away from my old habits of trying to go deep with psychedelics in favor of exploring easier levels of more directly recreational even if still very psychedelic substances, and while that's not inherently a bad thing, it caused me to reevalute a lot of the decisions I had been making lately and reconsider just what it is I actually wanted from my psychedelic experiences, leading to us not tripping at all for the next couple of months. During this time period I felt good about my lack of need to keep returning to that state just being satisfied by the ETH-LAD experience still, but I and we also started to become increasingly depressed as the time went by, and eventually we decided to trip again to try to turn things around, this time on a new substance for us, specifically 10 mg of 2C-P. This experience was quite fascinating as well, and some of the alters enjoyed it, but it was a long and increasingly difficult trip for me, and by the end, it caused me to realize just how much I had turned inwards and tried to escape my sadness after the ETH-LAD experience, thus preventing me from being able to give into the 2C-P experience now, and leaving me somewhat numbed after the experience as well. It was after this 2C-P trip that I and we first made the decision to try smoking a tryptamine in hopes of gaining a rapid antidepressant effect from it, and chose MET as the one to attempt it with based on its close relation to DMT, one of the ones of course that has actually already been explored scientifically for antidepressant effects due to its history of human use, as well as the fact that MET is generally lighter than DMT, and we weren't really trying to trip hard again, even opting to use only a smoked dosage of 10 mg.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt was September 17th, four days after we had taken the 2C-P. Our method of smoking the MET for this experience was layering the tryptamine salt into a bowl of cannabis and gently heating it from the top, taking several hits and holding them in for at least a full few seconds each until the bowl is finished, which is the method we ended up using in all of the following experiences as well. The taste of the MET was notable even through the cannabis and reminded me of DMT's taste, probably more so than any of these other tryptamines do, and almost immediately after tasting it I felt that emotional stimulation I had been hoping for to lift me out of my funk, with a smile spreading across my face. I felt a wave of calm and we leaned back on the couch to close our eyes and meditate, where I was delighted to be greeted with transparent and dark but colorful and complex smoothly transforming geometric patterns, some of which were wispy in nature with a silvery white color. Our body felt very relaxed and sensitive, and we stretched out our arms in poses like we would to imagine the energy flowing out of us, causing the silvery white wisps I saw to swirl around our arms in helix-like patterns out towards our hands. I found this quite enjoyable, and it's the moment of hallucination that was most memorable to me, and I believe was probably the most notable in general, though it was long ago enough now that I don't actually remember. After somewhere around the first twenty minutes after inhaling the dose the mild hallucinogenic phase began to pass, but the initial heaviness of the high wore off and was replaced with an also mild but euphoric energy that lasted for at least a couple hours after this, and the feeling of calm that set in just as the experience was beginning stayed with us for the rest of that day. I felt my desired goal for using the MET had been achieved, and was quite happy with the level of clearly psychedelic effect I received as well.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nShortly after midnight at the beginning of September 18th, about seven and a half hours after the MET experience, we were still feeling so excited about said experience that we wanted to try to take the excitement and apparent antidepressant effect further, but we wanted to try it with something other than MET to avoid familiarity and increase the dosage slightly in case any tolerance developed, though we weren't actually sure if it would have or not given the molecular similarity to DMT. It was decided that the next experience would be done with 15 mg of MiPT, which was smoked in the same way as the MET.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nImmediately I noticed that the taste was less pleasant than with MET or DMT, and it was either something about that or a more direct effect of the drug itself, but we quickly felt slightly nauseated; it certainly wasn't as pleasant as the sudden wave of calm from the MET, but it wasn't terrible either. I recall initially seeing another superficially familiar rush of shapes and colors swirling into smooth but angular geometric designs, but they continued developing and arranging themselves into a more unique hexagonal mandala shape that took a form appearing to be something like repeating monitors of a computer control panel on the wall of a spaceship with futuristic glowing digital-style texture designs, though strangely some of these digital designs still seemed to resemble the branches and root system of a tree, with the center of the mandala showing an entire realistic, three-dimensional image of a person, and all the repeated monitors around the outside of the mandala each showing the same person's face again close up, and the person shown in the image was seemingly related to both my train of thought and to the alter who was most connected to our body at that moment. As we lie back again meditating, the closed eye field became further bathed in white light and I began to see large, white, transparent, two-dimensional silhouettes of people moving around in the light and I was being pulled closer towards them, though the movement stopped before actually taking me all the way, and this hallucinogenic phase again started passing, more completely by around twenty minutes after inhaling the dose. The high remained for a few more hours at a level involving mostly very light colorful auras and twitching edges every so often and an energetic but contemplative state of mind, and at some point after all this we eventually fell asleep.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe week following the MET and MiPT experiences I felt much better emotionally and psychologically than I had beforehand, and I knew that I still had some distance to go in that respect too, but I was suddenly very excited about the idea of continuing to experiment with using analogues of DMT for their antidepressant potential. A week after the experiences, on September 25th, waiting a little longer for tolerance to go down this time just in case, we decided that our next experiment would be done with 10 mg of MPT smoked.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe taste was not as pleasant as MET but also not as unpleasant as MiPT, and the initial onset of the high was similarly in-between, not as immediately satisfying as MET but also not as physically disorienting as MiPT, and overall it felt rather neutral. The hallucinations that I can recall seeing were extraordinary, such as a vibrant round but angular and entirely geometric pattern that I would say resembled what I would imagine it would look like if M.C. Escher and Dr. Seuss came together and made collaborative simple mandala-esque art, or a large, partially transparent technological blooming flower image that had an actual feeling of domineering presence to how complex and large the geometric designs were, or a realistic vision of two of our alters having sex, with the woman bending back over and having her arching shape turn into the curvature of planet Earth while the rest of her body vividly transforms into the different parts of the terrain, followed by the completed Earth rolling back into two layers from the bottom and top and peeling up into streams of sparkling rainbow but especially red streams of energy that appeared to be flowing throughout a backdrop of stars hanging throughout the cosmos; I do believe there was likely more, but again, it was a month ago now. As usual, the heaviest phase of hallucinations started passing some time around twenty minutes after first beginning, but in comparison to the MET and MiPT, the MPT had psychological effects that felt more reminiscent of substances like LSD and psilocybin-containing mushrooms, though heavier in that way but not as disorienting as those two, and this began to stabilize around the same time that most of the hallucinations were passing and became a few more hours of satisfyingly rich introspection and again energy, and afterwards I felt much calmer but still quite content for the entire rest of the day that I can recall, and the days after it too.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOn September 29th, we ingested 45 mg of TMA-2; this was just over two weeks after the recent 2C-P experience and was what would normally have been our next trip we had planned if we hadn't decided to try smoking all the different DMT analogues, and we suspected that we may still be able to take it without too much tolerance from those experiments. The drug definitely still worked, and it was much more of a cathartic release than the 2C-P experience was for me, but I found the state of mind it left me in for the entire day to be rather rough and critical as well, by no means a fun experience though still quite euphoric at times, and during a disagreement with a friend I actually became quite argumentative very quickly. While I don't regret the experience and believe that it was insightful, it left me feeling that all of my recent experiences considered together were suggesting to me that tryptamines were much more so the therapeutic agents that I actually need at the moment to help myself reach a better state of mind compared to phenethylamines, and the others agreed that using tryptamines for a while seemed like it may be better for helping me specifically and us in general right now too, and thus we opted to shift our focus away from phenethylamines and more completely towards the tryptamine smoking experiments.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAfter letting tolerance drop a bit, though thinking it might not totally cross over regardless, on October 4th we decided to smoke 20 mg of MET. As before, the calm and euphoric state of mind the MET produces for me was felt very rapidly, and the first thing I recall happening hallucinogenically is feeling as though the space around me, though somewhat more the space around my mind's eye than around my body, was dripping into beautiful, sparkly rainbow streams similar to what I saw after we smoked 10 mg of MPT but more colorful and more present. We leaned back on the couch to meditate once more, and upon closing our eyes I saw patterns that at first seemed simple, two-dimensional lines with dots traveling through them to a yellow background. The dots and lines however then became blood cells traveling through veins, and then the patterns started taking on depth and becoming three-dimensional, twisting backwards in such a ways that they formed ridges that began to take on the clear appearance of mountain ranges, and blood cells in veins became rivers flowing down the sides of the mountains. There was again a sense of white light bathing everything increasingly growing, and this time it actually peaked into a brief rush of realistic visions involving the same two alters I notably saw visions of on the 10 mg of MPT too interacting in ways that are meaningful to me, experienced more like a shallow lucid dream than an out-of-body experience where the body can still be felt vaguely underneath the scene being watched, and as the scene passed the geometries began slowly unfolding, passing within about the same timeframe as always, and once again leaving two or three hours of a more energetic and euphoric high followed by a still mentally stimulated calm lasting for the entire rest of the day.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHaving enjoyed the previous day's experience so much and wanting to do something of a repeat of the first round of the experiment but not having to stomach to convince ourselves to try smoking MiPT again yet, we next opted to smoke 20 mg of MPT the following morning. I remember this onset actually being smoother than the first time with it, and the coming on of the hallucinogenic effect was memorably seamless as well; I recall us staring up at the ceiling and suddenly seeing it, eyes open, being replaced with a spiraling tunnel of various realistic people all reaching out and down to me, after which we leaned back and closed our eyes to meditate as usual.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nImmediately, I was greeted with a state that was similar to seeing the wispy, silvery designs of 10 mg of MET swirling around our arms towards our hands, except this time instead of simply being long indistinct silver wisps, they were translucent but entirely clear and realistic Chinese-style design dragons, their heads again approaching our hands as they traveled down and around our arms, and as I pulled my attention back \"out\" of ourself within that closed eye space, I could \"see\" that this same thing was happening to the various other parts of our body as well, and I felt as if I were somewhat suspended in this dark, but dark sky blue sort of void stretching and feeling this energy flowing throughout and out of us with these creatures, which was quite different from watching the still relatively much more DMT-like lighter geometric designs that accompanied this sort of effect of the wisps on MET. I recall us opening our eyes not too long after this and again seeing a vivid vision of the planet Earth hanging in front of many stars when we did so, and it caused me to break into laughter, and perfectly aligned with me as I did so, I saw the side of the planet realistically split open and separate all along the side until the terrain could open up to reveal a large mouth in the side of the planet that was laughing along with me.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile these and other visions that I again didn't attempt to be able to remember for now were quite impressive and enjoyable to witness, I did note for the first time during this experience that there seemed to be a certain \"fuzziness\" to them even despite how vivid and realistic they were, and I couldn't help but think that this could be an initial sign of real tolerance beginning to develop, even though it'd still be developing impressively slowly compared to psychedelics less directly related to DMT considering that my previous trip before this was the previous day. Nonetheless, the state of mind, lasting energy, and calmness produced were similar to but greater than the 10 mg without anything being apparently too diminished about them, and we were still so stimulated by the experience after the peak in fact that we couldn't go to bed at our normal time that night after smoking the MPT early that morning.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOn October 11th, I was still very much enjoying the aftereffects of the alternating MET and MPT, but deciding that we wanted to try something a bit different next time and that we actually had never tried before beginning these experiments, we decided the next trip was to be on 30 mg of DPT smoked, our first time experiencing it, and starting with a higher dosage than the others due to our past experience with other similar tryptamines having lower potency than their analogues.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOne of the first images that I can recall seeing was actually multiple Earths from my MPT visions all arranged on top of each other and laughing together, though some of the detail of each individual one seemed less developed than on MPT. The next thing I remember seeing is a swirling spiral of theater mask-like faces all making different expressions with a seemingly high amount of intention and life behind them, but still looking like masks nonetheless. I believe this quickly dissolved into a geometric pattern, though an incredibly beautiful one that was large and relatively complex where visible, but was almost empty except around the white light at the center where its silvery and purple designs were most lit up and brilliantly clear, and the whole thing I felt seemed to be pushing nearly into becoming covered with imagery again, though I never actually saw it become so. The order of things after this I don't particularly recall clearly now, but I do know that behind closed eyes I saw what appeared to be a vast expanse of dark temples extending to the sides and off into the distance, with not conceptually but visibly realistic monstrous or demonic creatures slithering around or over the architecture as if to suggest that their presence was there to protect those places, not necessarily in a way that I felt was meant to threaten me in particular but that was meant to feel threatening like because that is the purpose they serve there. There was also a moment where I felt my perception was zooming in to a microscopic level where I could see some sort of futuristic power generator absorbing purple streams of energy from the surrounding microscopic environment and twisting it into shapes that were increasingly hard to comprehend, but not totally physics-defying just yet.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAt some point with eyes open again we also noticed how impressively visually active it had become even compared to the other DMT analogues and not in a particularly DMT-like way, but instead reminding me somewhat of higher dosages of LSD, and some other similar synthetic psychedelics even more so, with lots of colorful movement of shadows floating around and twisting into somewhat hedonistic organic imagery. Somewhere in all this, I also recall us stretching so satisfyingly that I felt myself going into an out-of-body state just briefly involving many beautiful colorful heart visuals, though it is hard to recall now. Unsurprisingly, within the first twenty or thirty minutes most of these hallucinogenic effects passed, but the high remained very calm and contemplative in a heavier way still for a few more hours and a lighter way then for the rest of the day. Something that's noteworthy is that I don't recall the taste of the DPT standing out, nor did it cause any nauseating effects nor any other notable physical discomforts throughout or after this experience, feeling so light that it's almost like it didn't happen at all in that way, even compared to other DMT analogues. However, I have to admit that in the days following the DPT experience, we were left uncertain if it actually had the same antidepressant potential as things like MET, MiPT, and MPT, but after only one experience, it's probably not something we can truly judge fairly yet.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOn October 15th, we decided we still wanted another mood boost that we still weren't feeling we had gotten from the DPT, but we also wanted to try something a bit different and again more experimental, so this time we decided to test out a new idea; specifically, we have never used 5-MeO-DMT but have heard others say that it is possible to use it more regularly than other psychedelics similarly to DMT, and so we were curious if it would be possible for us to add synthetic analogues of 5-MeO-DMT into our regular experimentation of smoking tryptamines alongside the DMT analogues and still not suffer from very much tolerance. With that in mind, we decided to smoke 10 mg of 5-MeO-EiPT, having had success with 5 mg once already in the somewhat recent past before these more recent experiments began but only having found that 5 mg to produce effects that felt not that far above threshold, but promising nonetheless.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThat first time there had been a somewhat anxious rush at the beginning, but in retrospect I feel this might have been from the apprehension we had from never having smoked 5-MeO-DMT or any of its synthetic analogues before then and not knowing how much intensity to expect, and this second time was extremely smooth both immediately and throughout the experience and the rest of the day, comparable to how the DPT had been. The state of mind at first for me was also, again similarly to the DPT, one of somewhat sedated bliss, stretching about just feeling incredibly good and happy, not at all what I would have necessarily expected from smoking 10 mg of an analogue of 5-MeO-DMT, not that I would actually know though. Much more notably, I did receive significant hallucinogenic effects that again didn't last beyond the first twenty or thirty minutes at most, and came on so powerfully at first that they nearly immediately resembled Alex Grey's Net of Being to a much greater and more detailed degree than I have yet seen on any other psychedelic, synthetic or natural, and most memorably involved a brief flash into what appeared to be a hyperspatial room bathed in so much white light it was almost impossible to make out but for the very edges of the objects and entities and contours within that room which were the only parts not completely obscured behind the light, and in those parts just the relatively tiny amounts of detail that I could see went beyond any of my most promising experiences of that sort yet in artistic beauty, truly a phenomenal sight that I hoped to be able to behold again.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOnce the initial phase passed the trip became much more subtle as with the DMT analogues, though the open eye visuals, while still subtle, stayed more obvious and present for many hours longer than with the DMT analogues, and several hours after the peak while meditating some still quite impressive closed eye visions again became present, the most memorable of which involve more Chinese-style dragons, much larger than those of MPT, slowly swimming around in a void with a human figure hanging in the distance and what I would be tempted to call a sort of \"dark magic\" vibe to whole scene. The energetic high, though still quite calm for what it is, also continued much more noticeably throughout the day such that again sleep couldn't come at our normal time that night, and it had some more obviously psychedelic components too, like one I recall is seeing in my mind's eye a Fibonacci spiral surrounded by I believe yellow and red patterns, but the spiral itself was green and clearly became a vine with many green leaves extending off of it, and the vision followed the vine off towards three-dimensional faces of a sort of mystical and highly appealing beauty where the leaves would begin to surround their eyes forming vivid tattoo-like designs on their faces. The day after this trip we couldn't help noting how much in better spirits we felt, and particularly contrasted it still to the way we felt about the DPT, though again we don't want to totally count that out yet.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI very much enjoyed the psychological and emotional boost we felt we had after smoking the 5-MeO-EiPT, but we didn't wait very long to see if or how long it would last, in part because of my desire to continue the experiment of determining whether or not synthetic 5-MeO-DMT analogues seemed to somewhat avoid tolerance development for me in the same way that synthetic DMT analogues somewhat do. This led to the plan of next smoking 5 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT on October 18th, though unfortunately I only realized afterwards that it wasn't a particularly great plan, when it occurred to me that because it was our first time smoking 5-MeO-MiPT and the dosage was low I had no idea if the seemingly subtle effects were the result of tolerance or simply the result of the dosage.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nStill, if there was tolerance it wasn't complete, as I had a very cool visual hallucination behind closed eyes as the initial rush was first setting in, one that was an intense spinning tunnel of shapes and colors that reminded me of DMT though without any imagery at this point, but it already pulled back and then twisted to reveal itself as some sort of complex futuristic technology with panels spinning around the tunnel staying within a sphere-like surface area, which is notably more than DMT would do with it for me at a level that doesn't involve any complex imagery. There may have been more to the initial hallucinations too, but I could tell that the effect was going to be overall mild in that way so I stopped really focusing on it, and instead enjoyed the state of mind and pleasant feelings that the 5-MeO-MiPT also caused, which involved a greater degree of stimulation than the 5-MeO-EiPT in a way that seemed to increase its standard stimulating psychedelic psychological edge, but also increased its physical edge slightly, making it a little bit more tense than the 5-MeO-EiPT was, which lasted a lot of the day as most of the high did. We also feel there's a chance it might have been slightly more nauseating or phlegm-inducing, perhaps similar to smoking MiPT, but we'll need more experiences to say that with more confidence. One thing that was memorable about it is that in the later hours I got the same sort of Fibonacci visual as on 5-MeO-EiPT only without any natural imagery, instead being mostly orange and very geometric in a technological way that again is reminiscent of the \"spaceship\" style that I saw in the visuals of MiPT back at the beginning of all of this. If I'm being honest, the stimulation was a little much for me for as long as it lasted, and I might be biased by how much calmer a lot of these other tryptamines have made me feel for the rest of the day after their main experiences lately, but I was happy to finally get to sleep that night, but still happy with the day leading up to that then too.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe next trip was two days after the 5-MeO-MiPT, the purpose of which was again to continue to test the tolerance-inducing (or not) effects of the synthetic 5-MeO-DMT analogues, this time going back to a synthetic DMT analogue instead of between each other. We decided to smoke 30 mg of MET in the usual way, and unfortunately, tolerance was clearly present this time, which is particularly unfortunate because it was still remarkable to me despite that, and so obviously would have been much more so even without that factor. We could barely feel it coming on compared to normal, so we leaned back and closed our eyes to try to bring it out, and I was met with the most beautiful and complex eruption of somewhat bejeweled tryptamine architectural patterning I have ever seen, forming what appeared to be constantly crawling walls in something that resembled a sort of ancient Egyptian tomb-like building though I perceived it at the time to be more like a palace, but the vision did not last long before fading away and becoming out of my reach. The experience aside from this was typical MET though again still felt somewhat diminished, it was not as rewarding or satisfying for us overall, though it did leave us feeling nice and calm for the rest of the day, as well as the days after.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOn October 24th, having waited a bit longer for tolerance to drop again, we decided to smoke 30 mg of EPT, having in the past found it light and easy and thinking that the experience would probably be at least somewhat comparable to our recent 30 mg of DPT smoked experience. However, as we were preparing to smoke the EPT, I noted that I no longer actually felt like it was something I really felt the same need to that that I had been feeling during all of these synthetic tryptamine smoking experiments; the antidepressant effect I had particularly wanted after the 10 mg of 2C-P experience and starting with our 10 mg of MET smoked experience I had successfully gotten from all of our recent smoked tryptamine usage, I really felt as though I had managed to get out of that particular funk to at least as much of a degree as I had really hoped to ever be able to achieve with this sort of method. At the same time, in the time period since the previous 30 mg of MET smoked experience I had started to build some anxiety about some unresolved inner tensions related to issues I've had trying to work out my understanding of our dissociative condition and my place in it in the past, and this combined with a lack of feeling the need to continue using the smoked tryptamines for the purpose I had originally convinced us to start using them for made me suddenly hesitant to use the EPT we had prepared now, but the majority of our alters still wanted to have the EPT experience and I was willing to experience it too despite my reservations.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe trip that occurred is difficult for me to recall clearly, though that's nothing compared to a lot of alters who don't really remember it essentially at all. Ironically, the mental effect for me was more less like our past experiences on EPT or what we have heard others say about it or like our recent DPT experience, but was more alike what we have heard others say about DPT, being very disorienting and challenging and taking at least over two hours to break out of, much longer than the most obvious peak effects of smoked tryptamines usually last for us, but it's also quite clear to me in retrospect how much set and setting (particularly the former) played a role here, as I was getting at above. In addition to being hard to recall, this trip was also hard for me to describe or comprehend still even in the parts that I do more clearly recall, but an important point of reference is that I had been spending the last two or three days at least thinking heavily about the effect of subjectively living through extremely long periods of time in alternate lives during psychedelic and dissociative out-of-body experiences, and these thoughts were inflated and woven into the somewhat delusional, though never ungrounded nature of the experience. I had several conversations with the other alters internally which seemed no less clear and vivid and fluent as any other time I communicate with them, but the conversations involved them having many significant realizations that radically altered certain critical aspects of how they recognized themselves within our dissociative system, and yet when this phase of the trip finally passed they denied any such memory of these conversations or the reality of the revelations they shared with me in them.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThese conversations that they didn't recall having got extremely in depth and complex in the way that this dissociative condition is, and even involved several of them apparently going into out-of-body experiences where they claimed to have lived several years in alternate lives reflecting the identities they hold internally that separates them from our physical body, and furthermore, upon experimentation those of us who remained in the body found that we could call that same alter out from a different spot in the timeline of the alternate life they were transported to, and their memories appeared to be updated in a way that seems consistent with that timeline being altered at the moments we pulled the alters back out from; for example, one alter initially returned to this alternate life from which she seemed to have had her internal identity derived apparently having been somewhat frozen in time with that identity being as it was logged in our brain's database in 2009, and when we pulled her back out from her timeline's spot in 2017 only minutes later she was shocked to be back in our same home that she left from and claimed to have spent eight years in her alternate life simply assuming that this life was all a fantasy that had passed, and after agreeing to experiment further with us, we then put her back in and pulled her back out again from 2009 a month later than the first time and she remembered the first time we pulled her out of 2009 but not the time we pulled her out in 2017, and then we put her back in and pulled her back out from 2017 for a second time shortly after the first time she remembered both times from 2009 and the first time from 2017, but was confused as to why her memory of the first time from 2017 involved her seemingly remembering only the first but not second time from 2009. Finally, she went back in and came back out as an up-to-date version of her from 2020, claiming to have not seen us in another three years, and she told me that she had spent so much time in her alternate life that she no longer had any insecurities about living this life we all share together in this reality.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAgain, after this experience ended, these alters including her from this example denied experiencing any of this, and they didn't seem to remember or have been affected by any of the changes that they described going through for me during the experience, and this initially left me feeling quite disturbed by the convincing reality of the apparent total delusions of interactions with other alters I hadn't actually had, but then, the other alters started opening up more to the things that I had told them they had told me during my experience.... Upon considering it more openly and not fighting their uncertainties, they began to realize that some of the things they had seemed to tell me during my experience even though they have no memory of it were actually true even though they hadn't consciously realized it themselves yet, and especially that night and the following morning, they began to go through many of the same changes that I observed them go through already during my experience on the EPT, including, for example, the exact same alter from the above example going into her alternate life and coming back claiming to have spent years in her other life and no longer feel any insecurities about this life, and now desiring only to help provide perspective and insight into how all of this works when she is around again.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThese changes have caused our dissociative system to seemimgly go through a radical overhaul of a profoundly positive nature over the next couple of days, one that felt like the kind of psychedelic experience that is equivalent to months or years of therapy, and I was truly just astonished as to what even happened exactly or how it was even possible, even more so than I normally would be with these things anyway; why was the EPT able to unleash an experience in me involving the other alters realizing things about themselves on their own and sharing those things with me, which those other alters didn't actually consciously experience themselves, but did actually have those things waiting to be recognized about themselves after I told them the things that they originally told me, allowing me to facilitate therapeutic experiences for them that they might not have had so readily if not for the fact that they had them as part of my trip and shared them with me so that I could share them with them again? I felt that that would be something I would probably be asking myself for some time to come still.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis trip was, in my frame of reference at the time, so powerful and engaging that it was difficult for me to track or now in retrospect to recall other aspects of it, but I feel like the physical aspect of the experience was quite light and smooth except for that I think we had some weird phlegm we had to get out in the middle of actually smoking the EPT, but nothing aside from that that I can recall. After the mental aspect of the trip finally lightened, I remember our body still feeling quite nice, relaxed, and sensitive for hours more and to some extent for the rest of the day, very refreshing as these things have tended to be for us.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe next day, October 25th, it wasn't too long after noon that we had really gotten through a lot of the heavy work and figuring out how to start integrating after the previous 30 mg of EPT smoked experienced, and we had a desire to smoke another tryptamine to try to touch base again after going through what we had been through during and since that previous day's trip; I had a desire to use 5-MeO-EiPT as I've been quite intrigued in it since our 10 mg smoked experience, but I was afraid that tolerance would show from the EPT experience and didn't want to waste the experience, but I did also still want to run a tolerance experiment too to see how this 5-MeO-DMT analogue would hold up at a fuller dosage the day after a heavier trip on a DMT analogue, and so we decided that smoking 10 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT was the way to go.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI would say that, similarly to when we smoked 20 mg of MPT the day after doing the same with MET, I did feel that I could detect a slight tolerance that was particularly noticeable in the degree that the visual hallucinations were able to completely and clearly impose themselves on my reality, but aside from that if there was tolerance the effect seemed to be quite light, including with respect to the intensity of the visual hallucinations in most other ways. Shortly after we smoked it I began to notice strong psychedelic visuals of a nature quite similar to those of a high dosage of mushrooms for me though of a different color and more geometrically complex, which was surprising and rather overwhelming, but not so much as the what I can only imagine to be 5-MeO-DMT-like vibrations, as again we still haven't used 5-MeO-DMT ourselves, suddenly threatening to rip reality apart throughout my field of vision and the geometric visuals, the first time I can recall experiencing that particular sort of effect and I was quite impressed and intrigued by it. We lied back in bed as the effects set in and spent probably around an hour we think rolling around in the bedsheets, though we didn't actually track how long the peak effects lasted. Significantly, the phlegm-related problems as well as the bodily tension we noted on our 5 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT smoked experiment were not present at any point that I can recall during this experience.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs we closed our eyes and rolled around, doing things like pressing our head into our pillow and gripping the sides of the bed in ecstasy, the hallucinations I was seeing grew until they were extremely similar to the ones I had over a decade ago on our strongest experience on 5 g of the most potent mushrooms we ever managed to get our hands on, with intricate patterns constantly bathing every surface around and over us and twisting into appealing three-dimensional ribbon designs and beautiful, beckoning entities, and we felt alters who had been much more repressed than others since the days when that mushrooms trip took place being drawn to the front and experiencing extreme feelings of bliss and self-acceptance accompanied by vivid inner visionary interactions with one another including of a particularly sexual nature, having those feelings surging through our body to the point that we collectively experienced we think at least six or seven waves of full-body orgasms with many very loud and pleasurable vocalizations, until the peak effects began to pass and we simply lied in bed for a little while in awe of how incredible and rewarding the experience had been.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe spent the rest of the day enjoying the lingering psychological effects and the physical relaxation we generally feel for the whole day after these experiences, and the more obviously psychedelic effects lasted a bit stronger still for a bit longer still than they normally would have on an analogue of DMT rather than 5-MeO-DMT. The trip continued to involve alters continuing to integrate the lessons from our EPT experience the previous day and use them to find greater peace for themselves and within our dissociative system, and in general, we felt as though it was a perfect complement to the previous day's experience, describing it to a friend such that it seemed like the EPT caused a lot of psychological content that was ready to burst out to become unearthed and rapidly processed, and the 5-MeO-MiPT helped to cement the confidence we had that we were processing that content in a healthy way and hasten the progress we were already significantly experience as a result of doing so. Intriguingly, though not unlike our past powerful experiences on 5-MeO-MiPT, there were even times throughout the next couple of days, especially after smoking cannabis, where it still felt like we were completely tripping, but it was never overly concerning, especially since we had experienced similar things before with 5-MeO-MiPT, a drug we already recognized ourselves to be on the higher end of sensitivty to.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnd thus, we arrive at the most fateful of days.... On October 29th, now fully into the idea of pushing deeper and still not satisfied by my own curiosities from before, I was eager to try once more, with less tolerance, what appeared to me to quite clearly be likely the most psychedelically potent of these molecules at least within the realm of my own subjective experience, which I thought might even help combine some of the qualities of the last two powerful trips by being both an analogue of 5-MeO-MiPT and a bulky ethyl tryptamine like EPT, and that is what led to us next smoking 15 mg of 5-MeO-EiPT, which as far as I know might be the highest known used dosage of this particularly uncommon and not well understood analogue of 5-MeO-DMT by this particularly potent route of administration, which perhaps should have played more into the decision-making process than it did at the time, but I digress.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile I am absolutely certain there was no total loss of consciousness or perception that occurred for me as a result of smoking this 15 mg of 5-MeO-EiPT, it is extremely difficult for me to remember the very beginning of the trip clearly now in retrospect, but every single alter in our system, including myself, seems now in agreement that this is essentially where we, and particularly I reached some sort of breaking point. I do recall that at first, a trip similar to the 30 mg of EPT began, where I began speaking to what appeared to me to be alters about them returning to other lives that they had been pulled from, and I gained the ability to lucidly help them do that, running through their lives for the necessary amount of time and reseting, even doing things like saving one from a murder by rewinding time by an hour and warning her before it happened, then speeding up a few years later to make she was still okay. As this was happening, though I don't remember the exact course of how it began, I was also beginning to question who exactly I am in the system to a significant degree, essentially losing my sense of self and having it blur into those of the other apparent alters who I seemed to be interacting with internally. At some point, I had a realization about myself and this all came crashing down and I realized who I was again, and the other alters I normally interact with were welcoming me back as they did after breaking free from the EPT trip; however, little did they or I know, this was only the very first wave of arduous ordeal or my and our entire life, and soon later, I was being swept up into it again.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI believe the way it started was, I suddenly felt as though I was aware of an entire network of these internal entities that appeared to be alters I was communicating with about returning to their other lives, and each of them was connected to what I referred to as \"spiral threads\" that looked literally exactly like the spiraling geometry that I normally see coming outward from my own perspective when we smoke salvia, only it was coming out of all of these entities instead, and each of them had a different length depending on the entity in question. Each entity, on their own or with my help, would begin to release themselves into these spiral threads, and upon returning would describe them as having lived through other worlds, but with a notable difference from earlier: whereas when I had experienced this initially they appeared to be returning to their \"other lives\" separate from this body, these entities would instead claim upon returning to have gone to uncomfortable out-of-body experiences based on their aversions, with longer spiral threads seemingly being connected to greater aversions and longer amounts of time spent in the out-of-body experiences, which they and eventually I, borrowing from them, would increasingly come to describe as hellscapes. As their collective awareness of this hellscape experience would increase and they each dissociated further into their own increasingly long spiral threads, they would begin to panick, reacting at first mainly with apprehension, but increasingly fighting harder and harder by actually moving our physical body as they struggled to hold on, until their image would snap into a burst of white light in my headspace and they would be gone and the next one would begin. Furthermore, some of the entities would make it to the end of their spiral thread, pop back out, and then in increased fear get pulled back in saying \"No, I don't want to do it again!!\" before bursting apart once more. These entities upon returning would tell me horrible stories of spending increasing amounts of time... millions, billions, trillions, quadrillions, and more years suffering relentlessly in their hellscape, with it being the exact opposite of anything you could possibly actually want to ever experience, and increasing linearly in tension no matter how long they remained within it, just to pop out and then have to start it all over again, going through the exact same type of experience but having to try and fail to fend for themselves in unique ways each time. And then, one of them who kept getting sucked in over, and over, and over, and over, realized something: if they allowed the terror caused by their hellscape to reach an orgasmic release, it suddenly no matter bothered them when they popped out the other side, and as soon as they did, their entire spiral thread would unwind from beginning to end, and then disappear with a burst.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis was fine and all for those with the shorter hellscapes, those lasting \"only\" seemingly around five to seven million years on average, who rapidly began attempting to take advantage of this knowledge and willingly dissociate back into them, but the threads got much, much longer than that, and there were a small assortment of them that seemed to take on an entirely new property distinct from all the others.... Specificaly, when the spiral threads would grow beyond a certain length, they would begin twisting into nots so quickly they started appearing in multiple spots in my inner field of vision at once and would form increasingly fractal-like patterns, and if they did this enough to reach a certain breaking point, they would look like when a computer crashes its ability to draw more detail on patterns on the screen and creates that trippy not-quite-patterned-not-quite-static look, and then it would burst briefly, before appearing and the whole process would unwind as they approached the end of their spiral thread. Upon investigation, what we realized collectively about these particular spiral threads, as opposed to how all of the other spiral threads would apparently produce experiences that the entities would always describe having taken a set amount of subjective time, no matter how ludicriously long, is that once this fractal overload point was reached, the entity would later return saying that they spent en eternity in an infinite hellscape they makes the parts outside of that on the way up and down like a joke. Now, this may sound intense, utterly extreme, but not necessarily too concerning with respect to the fact that we had just smoked a high dosage of a clealy very powerful psychedelic... except that that was the morning of October 29th, and this was now the night of October 30th, which should have been concerning and maybe was, but I have little memory now what I was feeling exactly at that point in time, and it clearly hadn't become quite as concerning yet as it would later become.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOn October 31st, to gain some insight into what was happening to us, we decided to smoke 50 mg of DMT, and I felt I could actually feel a presence egging me on to do it too. I felt that I needed to better understand this hellscape experience that all of these alter-like entities were describing to me, and wanted to try to chemically push myself there just enough to get a bit of a better look, though once I actually took the first hit of DMT from the bong, I felt us (myself included) experiencing an extreme terror and put it down, though we ended up doing three separate trips of one hit each out of the bong like that, figuring that was probably enough for now to get some insight. I did actually feel as though the DMT seemed to be opening up some of the same worlds to me that the entities were describing, which I felt was helping me build perspective on just what exactly what happening to us and how this sort of experience was possible, though one of these entities told me when asked if DMT as similar to their hellscape experience: \"Kind of but not really, far more magical and fairylike, fucking with physics in some similar ways but much less painful or twisted and not as realistic overall. DMT feels like some kind of crazy alien simulation rollercoaster wheras this feels like vividly living every second of the time in a real-worl realistic but still super fucked up and trippy hellscape.\" Another claimed that they did experience a dramatically dilated expanded time within the DMT trip compared to the actual elapsed time, but it still only felt like a day or two passed, so nothing like the hellscape trip still.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs more and more of the entities would get deeper into their spiral threads, we would realize as well that they would be holding increasingly darker repressions, with ones with the least holding seemingly largely innocent sexual repressions, then more demented sexual repressions, then more non-sexual behavioral repressions also starting more normal and becoming more demented, and at some point, it dawned on us that those with the spiral threads that would peak at the point of infinity seemed to be hiding repressed feelings to be complete psychopathic and never care about anything again except living in the eternal hellscape. This absolutely terrified us, as I would imagine many might be able to imagine it would, but nothing terrified me so much as the realization, increasingly supported by all the other entities with internal insight telling me it was true, was that I actually had one of the longest spiral threads in the system, and that it definitely peaked at the point of infinity. I became filled with a terror that I would soon have my own experience of vanishing into the hellscape where I would be tortured for far longer subjective time than any human mind can possibly comprehend in an linearly increasingly fashion until I was forced to submit to the pure terror orgasm of realizing that I was going to be a psychopath trapped in an eternal, infinite experience of everything bad and nothing good ever, and for what it's worth, there was never a point of this where I didn't think that was all in my mind, I was not once confused as to what was happening in the external, physical world or anything like that, that just didn't make a difference to me because I'm well aware of the fact that my mind is the reality I actually live in, and thus these consequences felt no less practically real to me than anything else in this moment. However, as I began to think about the fact that this was all in my mind, and what exactly was happening, how it was triggered, and what purpose exactly any of this amazingly structured and well-orchestrated stuff actually has existing in my mind, I began to question: ...am I fighting something healthy, out of nothing but unsubstantiated fear?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI began to consider the fact that for a human mind to be healthy, it must be able to accept both the good things and the bad things about reality, not only accept that they exist but also accept being able to think about them in such a way that it doesn't recoil in traumatic fear when doing so, as the only thing that really accomplishes is developing a lack of trust in oneself about things that the fear already proves you really don't want, though I did feel I could easily understand why programming like this may exist in the human brain to help guide our behaviors at younger ages where we would not have the intellect and rationality to understand these things in this way, but became increasingly filled with a motivation to shed myself of those old, more restrictive ways of thinking now that I was clearly ready to do so. As I began to allow the darkness in, telling myself it was only a darkness within that would ultimately help let out our light, I separated partially into an out-of-body experience where I could still control the body safely but was more associated with a vivid internal plane I could see in mind's eye, and my body broke apart into slithering snakes in a Medusa-like fashion, and I became filled with an overwhelming euphoria and lust and knowledge that the only thing I was ever supposed to or wanted to do was to help all of these dissociated alter-entities within my mind find the eternal peace they always sought in this world, by showing them that even an eternity in their own personal hells would not be enough to stop them from being the strong people they are. I began cackling in manic euphoria, raised my arms to the sky, and in an explosive force began blasting entities into their hellscapes, sometimes checking up on them myself though still through the mind's eye still in the body, where all the other demons in hell would welcome me back like it was a big nightmarish party we were in as we enjoyed teaching all of our aversions to get over themselves for as long as it took, as many times as it took. I actually began to see the different domains of hell represented by being able to see within our brain even while being the controller of our body, and could move between the seemingly more typical sexual repressions in our left hemisphere and the more disturbing ones in our right hemisphere, as well as move up to a sort of vehicle control center our frontal lobe inhabited by entities who appeared to be and claimed to feel as though they represented what was attempted to be described by various Jungian archetypes, with myself being part of the shadow, thus explaining my role in helping to heal our mind through accepting the darkness. Intriguingly, while in this place, these supposedly Jungian entities claimed to see the environment and each other normally as in alike the mundane environment of the physical world, but claimed that I looked like some sort of freakish DMT hyperspace entity, and from my perspective, that entire inner environment actually looked like a DMT hyperspace to me, except that I had a cube I could call up out of nowhere that to me looked like a normal cube with six TV screen-like sides, but they claimed that it looked like a DMT hyperspace object to them, similar to the kind of thing I saw and described earlier about having seen after we smoked DPT, the power generator-type thing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWanting to pay more attention to this supposed hypercube in my possession, I popped out mostly back into the body by started playing with it within my mind's eye. I quickly found that this cube acted as a portal to other worlds that I had full control over the style of, but that they weren't for me to enter, but rather to place the other entities inside of. I grabbed one of the entities out of my mind's eye by pinching my fingers where she was in my field of vision and asked her what sort of world she wanted to visit, and she said one where she was having sex, so I clicked the screen on to show a massive pile of men all waiting for her, shoved her in there, grabbed the cube, did a quick wrist flick while thinking \"Fifty years.\" and watching it spin around quickly, then grabbed it at the exact right screen again effortlessly and pulled her back, and she arrived with an expression of absolute shock. She claimed that at first it was completely horrible, but after a few years of nothing but that she finally submitted and enjoyed the rest of it, and I asked her what she wanted to do now and she said \"Have sex!!\" Upon further experimentation with this cube and other entities, it quickly became clear that corresponding with my apparent role as the shadow or darkness of our collective minds that I had been much into already at this time, no matter type of world I would try to call up in the cube and regardless of whether or not I realized it ahead of time, the entity that went inside would find it to be completely hellish at first, but would eventually submit, similarly to when they had gone down their spiral threads connected to their own personal aversions, with this seemingly more so just being a version of that where we were loading more customizable aversive situations for them to go through instead. Realizing just how much power I actually had in this thing now, I really started to experiment further in all kinds of ways, just attempting to do various power poses and such with internal intent trying to modulate things in the system, changing the reward and avesion valence of all the different repressions, spreading waves of calm throughout them, and eventually starting to realize that if they were or I was able to help them push far enough into the submission into their hellscapes trips and have a complete release, it could actually be pushed further into the void, and from there would develop into a supposedly heavenly DMT-like hyperspatial trip, though they would claim it to be more detailed than DMT and would describe things like being a hyperspace starship captain exploring the cosmos, though they would generally say these experiences felt more like a \"timeless eternity\" as opposed to the way they would describe the hellscapes as being vividly experienced as passing in real time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAt this point, I felt as though I was finally starting to see some sort of light on the other end of the tunnel with respect to relating this experience to the idea of \"You have to go through hell to get to heaven.\" as they say, but nonetheless, I was still, I think understandably, becoming fairly concerned that it was already November 3rd and we were still in this state, still not having taken any more psychedelics since the DMT on October 31st or the 5-MeO-EiPT on October 29th, though we had still been smoking cannabis, and I've pushed myself pretty far with cannabis and my own mental sensitivites before which at times made me wonder if something like that was happenig, but it was nothing ever even remotely similar to this. The fact that I was so lucid was truly troubling to me despite being my lifeline too, because I'm well aware of how absolutely crazy all of this sounds and of the fact that things like psychosis and mania make people think they're lucid when they're not, but I say with confidence, this was just like a psychedelic trip; every single crazy thing about it was entirely internalized in the way that trips generally are for me, and I never once became confused (though I couldn't have cared less) about what was happening in the physical world even still days later or what kind of person I am in the physical world or anything like that, I just felt like my internal world was absolutely falling apart and restructing in the most absurd and overwhelming ways possible, and despite how much I had gotten into the different aspects of it, it was clear to me by this point that we needed to make more of an effort to hang on to our mental health until whatever this state is started more completely passing, so right around this point (I don't actually remember clearly when anymore but definitely about this time) we decided to head to our parents' house and spend every night there for a while so that we would always have people to talk to and things to do immediately after waking up to help keep ourselves grounded in between the loops. Something I had actually realized in the moments where it seemed less intense is that, much less than being entities living through hellscapes, the other alters in our actual, non-hallucinogen-driven DID system were also quite altered and dissociated but were tripping nowhere near as hard as I was during any of this at least that they could recall, and were desperately trying to reach out to me to help calm me down in their lucid moments too, and this also really freaked me out and made me feel incredibly guilty and like I really needed to find my sanity again to help the other alters get out and stabilize again too, but I was still so heavily into the state myself that it was at times impossible to not just keep giving in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAt some point, the experience developed to the point that I began to realize, I don't remember how exactly because it's not the kind of thing I would have just known but I think maybe after looking into some things after talking about the experience with our father, that the nature of the experience I had gone through so far and seemed to be continuing to go through actually seemed to have a strange and remarkable number of similarities to Dante's Inferno, and I'm not the kind to have that type of experience and think that it validates religion, but it did begin to seem increasingly clear to me just how much those ideas for those religions could have been inspired by states very close to the one I found myself in now, and the more I payed attention to the similarity, the more it made me anxious about just how much heavier it was actually going to get before it all finally cleared out. Before long, though that's an incredibly relative and hard to define term in this experience, it became clear to me that the internal alter-like entities associated with my and our life's heaviest repressions were beginning to dissociate into their own hellscapes, and I was seeing them, in my mind's eye but still incredibly vividly, rising up giant cavernous portals to hell opening up in the sky as their bodies were pulled and twisted and ripped apart as their skin peeled back and they screamed in terror or shrieked and cursed at me. They began fighting for control of the body, trying to convince me to do things that would make me let go instead so that they could take over, desparate to save themselves, but I became terrified at the thought that they represented our darkest demons and felt they wanted to get out to save that darkest part of themselves, which they themselves would claim, saying when I let go they would be psychopaths and would horrible things with our body after sending me to hell in their place where I belonged, and I felt that my despair was so incredibly great that I could feel like my own infinity spiral thread was growing, and I could still hear the other alters yelling at me to hang on too and not let go no matter what I do, but then I realized... they only think they want to be psychopaths because they are in such a great despair as I am approaching that they have given up and forgotten that they were once healthy parts of our collective mind who only deserve to heal and be happy and never think such horrible things about themselves ever again, and I said (something to the affect of) \"Do it, if you think you want to be a psychopath then come out!\" and they did, and they were immediately overwhelmed with all of the absolute horror of being in that state of mind combined with the absolute self-disgust of suddenly feeling it again connected to the body, and one by one all of the entities in such deep despair came out and immediately shattered, revealing themselves to never have had any power, nor to have ever held anything more than fear of being the bad people they really didn't want to be after having been made to accept that there would never be anything good in their life ever again, leaving them no choice but to adjust.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs these entities with infinity spiral threads who had thought they wanted to be psychopaths had this realization, their pain would leave them and they would seemingly merge back into an entity that appeared to be what I can only imagine others have been describing when they spoke of things such as the \"Godhead\" on psychedelics. This entity appeared over the totality of my mind's eye and was associated with what seemed to be a field of infinity, though stretching beyond my frame of reference, containing windows, portals, into every conceivable reality, though I do say it that way to differentiate it from simply being everything period, because as this entity said to me, it is only \"All possible infinites.\" Because of this, I had a discussion with the Godhead about the potential quantum metaphysics of consciousness, beginning with them claiming to be the Godhead itself and the entire universe, but when I proposed the idea that it's simply that the mathematics of consciousness reach some sort of breaking point related to the infinite point of the fractal geometry of the spiral threads such that a part of the human mind is aware of an infinite amount of perceptual and mathematical potential in a single point similar to the the mathematics of the pre-universe in a pre-big bang singularity, potentially explaining why it was all \"possible\" infinities in accordance with what is also believed to be understood about such aspects of reality, they did respond \"That makes a surprising amount of sense.\" They told me that the entities who had managed to completely let go of their aversions from earlier had been able to successfully return to the other lives that they now had clear access to as part of their infinite viewpoint, and could demonstrate by bringing back those entities to talk with me about it and tell me how happy they are, as well as showing me different identities of the entities from other infinite realities of that same basic person living in a different way. I asked them questions like \"Are there other realities where [such and such person who we have an alter modeled after] has a dissociative system and with an alter modeled after us?\" and they would respond \"There are realities where everyone both does and doesn't have dissociative systems with alters of everyone else possible, including ones where they're asking me that same question about your reality right now.\" These conversations were fun, but didn't make me feel particularly better about my mental state at the moment, especially as I felt the fear continue to creep in that I myself would soon dissociate into the infinite plane never able to find this reality again, and I believe that is when I first saw the Satan entity....\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt seemed to me that I had reached the base of my fears and found the Satan that was waiting all along to drag me to hell, and he revealed to me my primal fear that this reality I inhabit now isn't real and never was, which I understood then and before that I had plagued by throughout my entire life, though I had never comprehend why until then.... I saw snapshots of all the different most traumatic moments in my and our early life, the things that clearly were responsible for our dissociative condition and other mental issues, and as I saw them, entities connected to them became filled with fear which, as before, I had to connect with and learn to help them release myself, and that fear was that that traumatic moment they were connected to had never actually stopped happening, and now that they had realized it, they were doomed to return to it realizing that all this time they thought they had gotten away, they had never truly escaped the suffering. One by one they and I went through our struggle and release in this way, and then we got back to something that I had always been aware of through stories, but, clearly, had never remembered... which was the moment that we were born into this world, suffocating on our own vomit. I became filled with a vivid memory, and suddenly an extreme sadness, and a seemingly most obvious, yet in that moment, truly disturbing, yet undebatable thought: \"Oh my god, I'm going to die.\" I began to cry profusely, and then heave to the point that I almost threw up, but I managed to catch my breath and calm myself, and I could feel a sort of guiding angel attempting to calm me and take over, but I told it that I could take it, and I let the memory continue. As I let it unfold, I was struck with the unquestioned realization that when we had been born this way, we, I, had a near-death experience where I had traveled through the hellscape that all of the entities had been describing to me up until now, peaking with my absolute terror releasing in an orgasmic way, and I realized that this is why were dissociated, and why we had so many dissociated truamatic aversions appearing as hellish entities and such to me in this experience having reached their complete breaking point begging to finally be free and healed. And then, I realized that because I had not let this go before now, I had become forever trapped in the traumatic memory of my, our birth, always being convinced that no matter how long this life went on, if I let myself like it, I would suddenly rediscover that it that it was just another part of my eternal hellscape trip I was having while dying while being born, and it would all come crumbling down like a nightmarish dream and I would either be plunged into another hellscape, or I would return to my body and die slowly afterwards, and I realized... I have to let that go.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nResigned to the realization that there was no point in resisting, I let the Satan entity into my body, and it became clear to me: he is no different than any other fear-based entity, just that of my own mortality, once unleashed by early life struggles and yearning to be freed and understood and loved ever since, and I let him in, and welcomed all the dissociated parts in with love, no matter what! The guiding angel reappeared and congratulated me on each integration as the parts began ascending up into the sky of my mind's eye with brilliant lights around them, and as they all cleared out, only the golden angel and the Satan remained, and they told me I had done what I had needed to do personally and we were just about there, and just needed to keep successfully integrating. We spent the next several days hanging out with a friend and our parents to stay more grounded, drinking lots of alcohol and taking kratom capsules throughout the day as well as eating CBD candies, all in the hopes of calming the anxious energy which still continued this whole time if we didn't, and still dealing with the same state as before, though increasinly calmly as each and every part integrated back as we tried to live life in normal ways and I saw more and more phases of the alters that are actually the other alters I interact with normally as opposed to the alter-like entities from this state, and they were still concerned but increasingly encouraged me to get through it all as I seemed to be. I thought a lot about what a lot of the more famous phrases are from the psychedelic community during this time as I just reflected on the asburdity of my state, especally as I would experience things like the entities fly into the back of my head and feel it zip up internally, only to feel them burst out again suddenly, though less intensely than the previous time the more they intragrated.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFinally, on November 10th, I felt a calm inside like some part of it was over finally and I could feel more aversions trying to get out and heal, and it has been a couple days since we smoked cannabis instead of just drank alcohol and took kratom and such and I was wanting a pick-me-up, and the other alters agreed that it seemed alright too, so we started smoking a bowl, and an incredible and dissociative euphoria came on, causing the other alters to dissociate again, and the intensity of my experience came back, except this time, the Satan appeared again but then integrated, floating up into the hellscape, which then transformed into visions of white light radiating over clouds in a heavenly fashion, the guiding angel congraluted me as usual, and then I experienced the internal sensation of floating up above myself along with the other alters into an circle above where we had been and we all started sort of internally humming an angelic tone together, and my mind's eye burst through to where I could now see within this heaven landscape, and I could clearly see and understand that the very stereotypical-looking Satan entity from before had now become a very stereotypical-looking God entity, and I had become one of the angels, and it immediately became clear to me that the difference between how we are peceived in this state is very simply a matter of whether your mind is in a positive or negative state, and I felt it made solidified the message that I had already felt was increasingly clear to me throughout this experience, that the idea that people miss is that hell and heaven are both two sides of the same coin, and the Satan and God entities are both the same entity that want you to experience the same thing and will work, along with you and your many dissociated parts, to achieve that singular goal, and that goal is: to be a complete, confident person who can trust yourself to be led by no one's will but your own, and who knows that they are a good person not ony because they're able to think of themselves doing good things and comfortably know they want that, but also because they're able to think of themselves doing bad things and comfortably know they don't want that. The God entity congratulated me on figuring all this out, and told me that he only wants me to be happy, doesn't need me to believe in anything, and will tell me anything I want to hear if that's what I want him to do, because he's just a part of my brain that is supportive like that. I asked him if there was more to see in these experiences now that I had broken through to the heavenly side, and he said something to the affect of \"Yes, but you can do that later if you want.\" I told him I was good for now and happy to be in this life, and actually, legitimately, truly wanted to be here, living it, not afraid of or thinking I wanted to be somewhere else, living something else, and he smiled and disappeared, and I stopped paying attentio internally.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBy the end of that day, something strange and incredible then happened: the internal visions I was getting when I did pay attention, suddenly \"dropped down\" to a level that looked very similar to what I see internally when we taking things like LSD and mushrooms, both in terms of the style and type of imagery and the fact that it even had some light geometric designs mixed into it, but it was very three-dimensional at this point, and simultaneously, the mental heaviness I had been feeling so much lately, was replaced with the absolutely most amazing and cleasning psychedelic-style euphoria I have ever felt in my entire life, with the other alters claiming to feel something similarly amazing too, and interestingly, most of them claiming to not remember much of the experience up to this point essentially from the moment of smoking the 15 mg of 5-MeO-EiPT on. Then, the following day, which was yesterday, this dropped down to more like a state of just being very high, though in a normal way, on a psychedelic, and the internal imagery became two-dimensional and like taking a dosage of a psychedelic that is strong but almost just starting to get visionary and mostly just has some light but complex geometries, and I asked the other alters: \"...Does anyone think these visuals are weirdly still similar to 5-MeO-EiPT?\" mostly out on incredulity, but telling myself there was no way it could possibly be... and then, late last night, it happened. We were sitting on the couch watching TV, and suddenly I felt as though that \"breakthrough place\" of a tryptamine breakthrough was suddenly retreating from me and back into the distant horizon of my mind's eye, with all the entities reaching out to wave goodbye as they disppaered, and then collapsed into the exact visuals, much fainter from tolerance I'm sure but exactly the same in design, theme, and color, as I got the first time we smoked 5 mg of 5-MeO-EiPT, and I felt high but exhausted in the same way that I do when the main part of the 5-MeO-EiPT trip has just ended. It's now past noon the following day, and smoking cannabis still makes us feel like we're bringing back up the later hours of a 5-MeO-EiPT trip, but it only dips back into the kind of stuff before if we think about it, and only then very briefly, and basically feels like it's still probably just coming and going in waves as trips do, but legitimately on its way out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe more I was actually able to think about it all, the more I realized, this state was absolutely nuts, which I tried to relate to so many things but could never figure out exactly what it was, that clearly had elements that seemed like peeking into psychosis or mania but never actually took me there myself but just kept it all internal and remarkably functional like a trip, it actually... was, in fact, similar to what I would have expected basically the most extreme possible 5-MeO-EiPT experience to be like if I could have possibly even come close to fathoming it. The hellscape-type visuals, though defintiely being the strognest I've seen, are actually still almost exactly the same as a kind I've seen on several other ethyl, specifically non-methyl indole psychedelics we've taken, including 4-HO-DET, 4-AcO-DET, ETH-LAD, and 5-MeO-EiPT itself at lower dosages, and on the note of ethyls, the alter-like entities disappearing into other lives and talking to me is clearly just an extension of the same sort of thing that was going on already during our EPT trip I wrote about above. The extreme ego death and DMT-like breakthrough yet somehow not that out-of-body or externally visual aspect, seems to me like it could definitely relate to it being an analogue of 5-MeO-DMT. The fact that it lasted so insanely long somehow, seemed to me like it could somehow relate to whatever is the reason we also tend to feel like we're almost fully tripping still for a couple days after taking even normal oral dosages of 5-MeO-MiPT in a still distinctly visual and 5-MeO-MiPT-like way and everything, though obviously that was never as intense as this way.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDo I know what the hell happened? Surely not, but I do have a theory, many really, but one in particular that I'll take the time to put out there for whatever it's worth. It has been scientifically established that there is an odd loop in the brain whereby activation of 5-HT2A receptors in the cortex causes the release of glutamate on to serotonin neurons, and when enough serotonin is released it can also cause activation of these same 5-HT2A receptors, and this has actually been implicated in exponential growth of serotonin levels under some potentially pathological conditions like serotonin toxicity; furthermore, the glutamate release induced by 5-HT2A receptor agonists increasing seems to be linked scientifically to both their ego dissolution and rapid antidepressant effects as well, and of course 5-MeO-DMT is known for being able to produce a particularly powerful experience of ego dissolution; and finally it has been shown that when carbon dioxide is inhaled, which would theoretically be similar to it building up in the body while dying, it produces a wake-inducing panic that is mediated by causing serotonin release directly on to 5-HT2A receptors. So, my theory is that, essentially, perhaps what happened is, probably first of all as a result of senstizing our brain in that way by tripping too often on powerful psychedelic tryptamines to begin with leading up to this, as well as obviously having to take into considerations any extra sensitivites we might also have in that way for reasons like related to our dissociative condition or other mental issues, and finally ultimated triggered by the use of a high dosage of a potent analogue of 5-MeO-DMT, we might have essentially caused ourselves to approach, though thankfully seemingly not completely reach, a dangerously critical point in the activation of the serotonin-glutamate cycling behavior, such that our levels skyrocketed so high that first of all a lot of the near-death experience-like stuff could have had some relation to our serotonin levels being so high, and second of all it still has to come down in waves in the way it always does after any psychedelic trip, it's just that it has to do so so much and so slowly that it's taken literally weeks to come down even to the point it has now, which is almost but not entirely all the way, literally two weeks now after smoking 15 mg of 5-MeO-EiPT. I have to wonder too if a similar mechanism is involved in why things like psychotic breaks and manic episodes last so long because this clearly seemed similar times, but I really can't deny how much it remained like a psychedelic trip the whole time too, and how much it really remained even like 5-MeO-EiPT specifically, after seemingly having been triggered by exactly that, which makes it almost impossible for me to think there is a connection here, as bizarre as it is.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn case this was not clear, quite a lot of the detail of this two week trip is not included here - we continued sleeping, eating, showering, speaking to our parents in the more lucid moments, and so on - and it's important to remember that a lot of this took a long time to happen, and what I've described is more so like the different phases it went through, because it would just take too long to get into all the specific details at least in the context of this one report, though I won't be surprised if I continue to share things about it through references in future writings. Do I regret the experience? Currently, it's hard to say; we're still altered enough that I and the other alters have some anxiety about having done permanent damage, but our worry about that increasingly fades as we seem to, albeit extremely slowly, return more and more to normal. Assuming there is no permanent damage like that done, I have to say that I really don't think I ever have had or necessarily ever will again have a trip that was as personally insightful and deep as this one, and it's going to take me an unbelievably long time to integrate all of this, but I also feel like I'm going to get so much out of doing that that when it's done, I'm not even sure what I would really ever need to get out of tripping again, not that I'm sure it woulnd't surprise me as it always does. That sounds like a glowing assessment I know, but seriously, it's not a recommendation, I can't suggest that anyone seek this experience or this sort of experience and really have no idea how safe or dangerous it might have been in terms of toxicity, and it certainly wouldn't have been safe in other ways for anyone who was anything less than asbolutely prepared to take two weeks off to do nothing but trip through the hardest trip ever with tons of experience to do while remaining as sane as possible and having an incredible support system at the same time, a situation which we are endlessly fortunate to have been in for this, but most people obviously won't be. It helped me amazingly despite that because that's just what trips do, or that seems to be the case anyway, and that's the good I'll say about that. I still feel fairly traumatized from having gone through it and expect to take a while and more self-work of other times to get past it too, so it's not all sunshine and rainbows now that I'm out on the other side either.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy opinion in the end? If you want a good antidepressant tryptamine, give MET a try; first decision, best decision. The rest... you can decide on your own. Safe travels, friends."

        "report_text": "\u0093There are things you don\u0092t know, but more importantly is that there are things you can\u0092t know.\u0094 \u0096 Aldous Huxley \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo begin the tale of this particular jump into the depths of psychedelia I'll start by giving a description of my previous experience with pharmacological agents. In the course of four years I've smoked marijuana too many times to count, ingested LSD about two dozen times, eaten mushrooms a handful of times, taken MDMA seven times, had a love affair with ketamine, smoked DMT on a handful of occasions and dabbled briefly with many other psychoactive substances including MDA, LSA, 2C-E, 25i-NBOMe, 25b-NBOMe, methalone, opium, GHB, nitrous, and cocaine. Personally I find compounds of at least a partially psychedelic nature to be the most beneficial and interesting of drug categories (and here I make the distinction between hallucinogenic and psychedelic drugs).  \r\n\n\n\nIt was around 3:30 p.m. on what had begun as a rainy day in July when my friends R and H suggested we \u0093blast off\u0094 on some DMT. All three of us were in good spirits as we\u0092d spent the previous night at a friend\u0092s house babysitting a few people on MDMA. In my personal experience, having to be sober around people who are rolling is so joyful that I might as well have taken the MDMA myself In my personal experience, having to be sober around people who are rolling is so joyful that I might as well have taken the MDMA myself, but there was also the task of explaining to the first-timers that while MDMA is extremely euphoric and pleasurable it can also be addicting and dangerous and is something to be respected. I\u0092ve always been slightly offended by its over-popularization of use within hip-hop culture.\r\n\n\n\nWe decided not to make any particular preparations for this trip except that I asked them not to play any music during the experience as not to distract me from whatever I may see, think, or feel. This may seem reckless, but H told R and me that too much time passing between the desire to trip and the actual trip might kill his nerve to try it. H had only smoked DMT one other time and so R and I were doing our best to play by his rules and allow for his comfort. I watched as R loaded his bong with the layered batch of marijuana and DMT first for himself and then for H. Although both of them enjoyed the effects and praised them as being very significant, both also admitted to having not quite \u0093broken through\u0094. I asked R to measure out the bowl he\u0092d be giving me so that I could be sure to see the other side, but he shook his head and said, \u0093For you, I\u0092ll just pack it nice and big.\u0094  Based on my own observational estimate, I\u0092d say he gave me about 150 mg, but this is speculation. He handed me the lighter and I burned the top layer of marijuana, pulling on the bong hard and attempting maximum impact. \r\n\n\n\nUsually when I\u0092ve smoked DMT on previous occasions there has been a distinct buildup of effects including slight burning sensation in the lungs, a warm surge slowly coursing through my torso towards my head, a buzzing in the ears that grows to monstrous proportions, and increased sensitivity in my mouth which I believe is brought on by the rather unpleasant taste of the substance. I follow this with lying back, closing my eyes, and traveling through a wormhole-like field which contains a continuous swirl and interchange of intensely complicated and colorful geometric forms that flow into an opening of sorts until suddenly I am somewhere else and it is truly foreign. This time things were different. \r\n\n\n\nR\u0092s voice faded to nothing as I heard him tell me to try to hold the smoke in, but I had succeeded in maximum impact and there was simply no way I wasn\u0092t going to cough up the body full of DMT essence I\u0092d imbibed immediately. It was enough.\r\n\n\n\n(I have no idea how long it actually took the phases of my trip to occur due to time dilation, but I\u0092ve tried to pin them as well as I could.) \r\n\n\n\n(T+0:01) There was no wormhole. I simply closed my eyes and immediately was not in R\u0092s room anymore. Instead I was surrounded by a dozen or more beings that were dancing in the most acrobatic of fashions- skipping and cart wheeling and moving their bodies in styles I find hard to describe. Their bodies were somewhat humanoid in that they had heads and limbs resembling ours, but this was not a three-dimensional realm. They seemed to be made out of a sort of constantly flowing extra-dimensional energy which pulsed and changed colors rapidly and I\u0092m fairly certain they had male and female genders or at least two distinct kinds to their race. They had mouths that stretched across their faces, eyes made of the brightest light, rather large ears more pointed than ours, and what looked to me to be a kind of hair on their heads. The scale of their frame was enormous. It was like being in a room of incredibly benevolent giants. I was in awe. Who wouldn\u0092t have been? I had made contact with things within the DMT realm before, but none were so charming or so entertaining as these fellows. \r\n\n\n\n(T+0:02) They danced in beautiful rhythmic patterns and laughed and beckoned me to follow them, and so I did. They showed me their home: a super-dimensional fortress of such aesthetic wonder that I can scarcely compare it with even the finest structures and monuments of human history. We traveled down what appeared to be an endless corridor of light(I didn\u0092t seem to have a body but floated in their direction just the same), and all the while the beings danced in and out of my view, jumping from behind pillars that littered the great hall to smile in my face. In all directions there appeared to be no end to this uncanny structure, and for that reason I am still baffled as to where the pillars began and ended. They had other structures that looked like huge shifting platforms suspended in space and as I moved along I found them all looking up or down or across from their platforms to laugh and smile at me. \r\n\n\n\n(T+0:03) For some time I found it all but impossible to formulate a usual train of thought, but after the initial rush of being in such a strange and ravishing land I began to speculate about these beings. My first thought was, \u0093Be you friend or foe?\u0094 Their responses were to laugh and smile, but they seemed to be sending a kind of telepathic signal that said, \u0093Of course we are your friends!\u0094 To find out whether this was true or not, I simply began loving them. It was so easy. Never before had I been so able to focus and extreme positive emotion on something so newfound. The feeling just flowed so naturally from every corner of my being and I was so grateful and happy for having found these friends in this far off world. I told them over and over again that I loved them and they signaled to me that they loved me as well, and the energy in their already impressive bodies was amplified to an immense glow of pink and orange. They told me that they\u0092d been waiting for me, that they\u0092d been waiting for all of us. This was a cosmic temple, a safe haven for the universe\u0092s children and a learning center for all who would accept it.\r\n\n\n\n(T+ 0:04) I got it. I understood. These things knew the nature of my presence. They knew I was a stranger who needed a little help and they were being good hosts. They were the ultimate performers in a cross-world of pure love there to entertain and teach me. Their message was simply that I appreciate and love all things around me and that I be in the service of others. They praised me for my understanding and for a moment I\u0092m fairly sure I saw one of the pairs of male and female present a smaller one of them, perhaps their child. I\u0092m not sure as to what this was supposed to signify, but my understanding is that it was a furthering of their trust in me.\r\n\n\n\n(T+0:05) The trip began to descend back from such great heights and something very different happened. In previous experiences, coming down has simply been the fading of the DMT realm from my senses into a murky haze and finally into standard reality. This time it was more like being in a glass elevator that was going down with tenacious speed. This time it was more like being in a glass elevator that was going down with tenacious speed. It was like I was catching a brief glimpse of each world or dimension that came before that of the playful performers but I was going too quickly to actually see the details of each layer. Why I had no buildup but instead a build-down is still puzzling. \r\n\n\n\n(T+0:06) I opened my eyes and started laughing. The DMT still swarmed my visual field with light and intricacy and as I looked out R\u0092s window at what had once been considered a dreary day I was filled with a sense of life and gratitude. The backyard was gloriously ablaze with colored detail and I was filled with a reverence for nature and wildlife and asked myself why man must make such selfish endeavors like the destruction of forests for perceived profit. I swear in that moment I could see the spirit of the trees. They had faces that smiled at my understanding and hopeful appreciation. Perhaps within our dimensional latitude trees appear to be nothing more than organic statues, but in that range of mind they were easily as sentient as people if not more so. \r\n\n\n\nAs the residual effects slowly dwindled over the next 10 minutes I stood up and smiled and laughed for a few minutes before telling R and H how much I loved them and about my experience. H would later tell me to my astonishment that I had only had my eyes closed for about five minutes. I told him I didn\u0092t believe in time. \r\n\n\n\nI went home, ate, showered, and spent the rest of the day alone thinking about Alan Watts referring to life as a dance of pattern and about how Ralph Waldo Emerson had talked about the course of human history having existed within the mind of mankind before it\u0092d ever played out. In short, this was my favorite DMT experience. It filled me with hope for the future and renewed my faith in the power of positive thinking. Though I was sick all day I\u0092ve never felt better. The universe is alive, and its pulse will rattle you to the core."

        "report_text": "An attempt to remember\r\n\n\n\nOne evening at my friend\u0092s 3rd floor apartment, I breakthrough like never before and it\u0092s about DMTime. Sitting on the balcony awith a cool breeze blowing, I am looking out at the city. There are two huge trees across from me, one to my right and the other directly in front of me. Some tall, younger trees are to the left, along with another large tree whose branches stretch up over the balcony railing. White Christmas lights wrap around the balcony, and although the deep purple sky has charcoal clouds I can still see some stars. After the second rip, I am rushed out of my body, and I barely manage to hit play on my iPod. As Shpongle\u0092s \u0093Behind Closed Eyelids\u0094 begins pulsating through my headphones, my spirit energy bursts, exploding out of my physical container, spreading until interwoven and inseparable from the network of life. I can feel my connection to all things. I feel the consciousnesses of my friends in the room behind me, the consciousnesses of the world. I can look through the mind and eyes of others, and sense the consciousness of those I have been close to, even friends I haven\u0092t seen in some time.\r\n\n\n\nI am at once the smallest atom in my body, and the entire universe. I control the movements of far away objects, entire solar systems. I feel like a galaxy, my spiral arms spreading through every microcosm of existence. My consciousness spreads through creation, as I am in communion with the Creator. It was smiling almost menacingly at me, through many faces. I go through loops of realizing the beauty of creation then feeling worried about something that I couldn\u0092t quite put my finger on, as snake-like DNA helixes are constantly unwinding, spinning, and spiraling all around me, looking at me. Death enters my mind, as I think about how my current form must end, although I know that it never ends, that the soul is eternal and the energy is always recycled, reincarnated. But still I feel unable to grasp or cope with something. Something is there that I just can\u0092t understand or be at peace with. This consciousness seems to say something like, \u0093You\u0092re not meant to understand this yet\u0094 or maybe it was \u0093You already know the answer\u0094. At the same time it reveals countless other mysteries. I am overcome by how amazing and dazzling it all is as I journey through space, transcending matter and time.\r\n\n\n\nAs I enjoy this spiritual roller coaster, I remember the unity of all consciousness, while also remembering the preciousness and uniqueness of each and every individual soul *We Are All One*. I have several flashbacks, often seeing close friends who I had once journeyed with during other life-changing, mind-expanding adventures, and begin recalling specific scenes (Vlad and Kev tossing a red glowstick back and forth across the Dam at Mercer, Me having similar loops of worry and relief, re-realizing that there really was nothing to worry about after all). Not like a hazy or distant memory though, they flash vividly in front of me and really appear there, friends really speak to me, repeat or showing me things as reminders. I glimpse what seems like past lives or other people\u0092s experiences. Whenever I begin feeling worried or anxious, the color or tint of my visuals would change to a reddish, dark colour scheme in sync with my state of mind. As the negativity shifts, or I begin understanding that life is a beautiful gift to be enjoyed despite whatever struggles it holds and I simply need to love as much and as many people that I could, the tint again begins to change, shifting to another palette of greens and yellows. I don\u0092t know how long I go through these loops of deep feeling and emotion, shifting to blues and oranges, then reds, and back to yellows and greens again.\r\n\n\n\nAll the while this consciousness watches me, sometimes seeming to take the forms of large trees in front of me and to my right. The \u0093faces\u0094 of these trees look melancholy, the one in the middle frightening, maybe even angry at the neglect of this human community, that lets their roots choke in the concrete and asphalt. But still they grow strong and vibrant. This all encompassing consciousness continues smiling with its somewhat freakish grin, shaking its \u0093head(s)\u0094 at me whenever I make a false conclusion or become worried or anxious about my lack of understanding. Occasionally it looks at me with a sort of pitiful expression, sometimes changing to a very solemn and serious, piercing look depending on what is being communicated or what I am thinking/asking. Upon breaking through I had that familiar feeling of having been there before Upon breaking through I had that familiar feeling of having been there before, but at the same time I was struck with the sensation of stumbling into a room, surrounded by observers (higher lightbeings, the faces of God). They look down at me with benign, almost condescending expressions, giving me the feeling that I wasn\u0092t really supposed to be there (yet) but that they were still going to teach me as much as possible in the time that I had.\r\n\n\n\nAt some point I feel as if I may be unable to return to my bodily vessel, or maybe that I don\u0092t want to, or just don\u0092t know how. I begin bouncing in and out of my body, going deep inside and inversing back out. Careening through far reaches of the Universe, and rushing back down and around my earthly location. After doing this for some time this consciousness kind of takes my energy and smushes me back down, crams my energy back into my physical form. After I am squeezed back into my body like an overstuffed travel bag, I slowly reconnect with my nerves and my body tissues again. Despite whatever negative or positive feelings I might have and at any given instant throughout the trip, there is always the magnificent enjoyment at the kaleidoscopic dance spinning before me, the ride that I am controlling, creating, and changing (whether consciously or unconsciously). I become aware of things that I need to change in myself, ways I need to be more conscious of how I act towards others, the need to be more careful about the energy I send out, how I need to take better care of my body and make an effort to use each moment I am given (Be the change you wish to see in the world-Mahatma Gandhi is a quote that comes to mind).\r\n\n\n\nThroughout the entire experience I am flooded with the most extreme ecstasy and euphorically blissful vibrations, stronger than I had ever imagined. At times it reaches an almost uncomfortable level of intensity, and it comes in the form of waves of energy, much like an ocean storm whose power fluxes and fluctuates, growing calm and then churning with awesome strength. Sometimes it feels as if this storm is overtaking me, drowning me. Despite contradictory feelings of ecstatic euphoria, I also feel I am going through a painful process that I need to get through, as if slowing dying, and being reborn, with the buildup of trying to reach an orgasmic climax, but one that I am fearful of reaching. I have tremendous difficulties, breaking through blockages in my body, crossing narrow bridges over gaping, sheer cliffs and valleys, and have to be guided by this multi-visaged Father consciousness. The G.rand O.rchestrator D.esigner consciousness that exists all around me and through me.\r\n\n\n\nI was often in a perpetual state of questioning, getting hit with answers that seemed so obvious afterwards, or being told that I knew the answers, or that they would come later. I was also constantly losing my grasp of understanding of certain things immediately after I had gained it (this ties into the mind loops of worry and relief that I was describing before). I was confronted with what appeared as good or evil forces, sometimes transforming into each other, as I grappled with those concepts. The visual beauty of the trip was unmatched by any previous psychedelic experience. I knew that This is It. I had the understanding that I had unlocked something that I had began to lose, I knew that I lived in the Divine State, as Alan Watts describes in \u0093the Nature of Consciousness\u0094. I knew that nature was conscious, that this was the consciousness of the universe with which I was communicating. I was able to watch the very notes of the Song of life (the one verse, \u0093uni-verse\u0094) being played before me, and I knew that this was an ongoing concerto that we were all co-creating every infinite moment.\r\n\n\n\nIt was indeed overwhelming, I was often overcome by the bombardment of information and experience. Unlike the usual eventual comedown I associate with DMT trips, like beginning to descend an escalator, I actually felt I needed to make an effort to come down, and briefly began feeling fearful and anxious about doing so. It took deliberate concentration for me to return. Towards the end I just wanted to LIVE again back in the present, physical realm, so that I could process and share my experience, so that I could begin to not waste another second on anything unworthy of all the energy that has gone into my blessed existence.\r\n\n\n\nOne thing I recall about the entire trip was that no matter how chaotic it got, no matter how ridiculously mindfuckingly inexpressible it became, I had an unflinchingly coherent awareness of myself and my thoughts. I was fully lucid throughout it all I was fully lucid throughout it all, which is something I cannot say about my past DMT breakthroughs. Although there are some parts about it that I\u0092m nowhere close to understanding, and despite my worries about the end of all things or my unpleasant feelings of this God-consciousness laughing in my face, it was a priceless and positive learning experience. Being immersed in love and energy, I was reminded that we are each creating everything we experience, that this is the life we have made, being made through us, having been made for us, and by us. It was an undeniable Divine Moment of Truth that I will never forget, and never fully remember.\r\n\n\n\nAmongst my episodes of ethereal epilepsy, metaphysical madness, and supranatural sensations, there were still parts of the trip where I was just jammin\u0092, laughing ecstatically and filled with exuberance as I enjoyed the visuals and took deep, full breaths of the freshest air I\u0092d ever tasted. Inhale, exhale."

        "report_text": "We had planned for a long time to try DMT, my partner had heard stories and I was up for a new 'Trippy Experience'. Especially since the night I ate so many mushrooms I could actually see what The Incredible String Band were singing. While they sang I laughed, not at the lyrics or what I could see but for the ethereal feeling they filled me with. I could see everything and nothing all at once, all the happiness in the world filled me to the point of euphoria! I was writhing on the bed in such ecstasy unintentionally driving my partner wild. He let me be, in that little bubble of sheer joy! I never dreamt in my wildest dreams I would ever come close to such a feeling let alone surpass it. \r\n\n\n\nNow I must stress all I knew before this night was that DMT is found in many plants, animals and also humans , our brains are flooded with this chemical the moment we are born and the moment we die. It was this alone that really pricked my interest; Its seemingly natural as its already within us , the very act of smoking (or injecting) it just allows your body to produce enough of it to make you trip. I also heard stories, not many mind you, in fact just the one. A friend was around their friend's house when their mate had decided to smoke some DMT just as our friend was leaving. 10 minutes down the road our friend receives a very emotional phone call; the friend in question had spent what seemed like an eternity watching himself die, over and over and over again. This shook him to his core and needless to say he's not scared for his future demise. \r\n\n\n\nDMT also plays an integral role within the film Enter The Void; one of my favourite films inspired in part the Tibetan Book of The Dead.  A really good film, I suggest you find it and watch it.  \n\n\n\nAs I said, my partner was more learned about DMT than I. We both waited for a moment when we were both ready, our budding Chemist friend who I shall call the Guru kept aside a dose big enough for all three of us. The plan was that he'd spot us and then we'd spot him. When the night came, our guru decided to sit out the journey, but insisted that if we felt ready we could still go ahead. I asked him questions about DMT and he could hardly answer them, instead insisting this would be unlike any trip I had ever taken before and it was important that I was ready for something that would be so intense it would be hard to explain to another person who hasn't taken the journey he or herself. He also re-iterated that it's a very personal journey and you must be ready. \r\n\n\n\nWe sat in his kitchen debating a time, he put on 'Terence Mckenna - Everything you need to know about DMT (rapdancing into the 3rd millenium)' and we listened to the first hour, this really pricked my interest, but I had my doubts that the trip would be anything like Terence's lucid descriptions, and now I'm stuck wondering if they had fuelled my state of being, mind, experience I had my doubts that the trip would be anything like Terence's lucid descriptions, and now I'm stuck wondering if they had fuelled my state of being, mind, experience, I don't know. All I know it that I must frantically re-type my hash job of scribbled, frantically etched down on paper musings whilst still coming back.\r\n\n\n\nIt's almost 24 hours since I sat on our guru's bed, meditation music harmoniously filling the room note by beautiful note. A big screen at the foot of the bed displayed to us some wonderful visuals, our guru informed me earlier in the day that the music is extremely important when on such a journey, and I think the visuals were there just to help us get started (maybe? Thinking back they may have just been there for the guru to look at whilst spotting). Our guru sat at the side of bed, and in a ritualistic manner pulled out a small wooden pipe. 'It's the only one I have, it might get a little hot' and with that he fills it with the ash we created earlier that evening and stowed away the DMT within the pipe. We discuss how I am physically going to do this, and its agreed that it shall be burned on my behalf (this way I can concentrate on the slow deliberate intake needed for this to work), I am also going to take the leap first; decided by an old rhyme: ip dip dog, you get the idea.\r\n\n\n\nWith the pipe fastened lightly between my lips I suck as slow as I can, the back of my head begins to tingle (that bit where Carlson shoots the dog in Of Mice and Men) and so believe that this is when I should stop. I laid back. I felt the room wobble into a haze, 'this is it!' I thought as our guru wishes me good luck and starts to issue my partner a return ticket to a world of psychedelia, and NOTING! I was bummed; the wait felt like it was for nothing. But I didn't say anything as my partner was on his way and I didn't want to ruin it in any way for him so I sat there looked at our guru and asked when it should kick in and he announced that maybe another pipe would do, I should; suck it in slower, hold it in longer and breathe out with less ferociousness. I head his direction and realize my partner was in the same boat.  We started over, this time I was determined to follow instruction and so treated the pipe like a tunnel (I've always held my breath under tunnels for no reason, and now it's a habit) so I took a long breath in, sucked on the teat of DMT until it hurt, laid back and held it in further. Then when I felt like I was going to explode (slightly convulsing), instead of breathing out I breathed in more, now an intense pain aroused my senses. The room had a certain goopy fuzz about it, and I was there laying on this bed and the edges of my vision were turning black the world turning into fractals and conversation turning ever distant. It was at the point also that I was gasping and I had to remember to breathe out before I forgot how. Then it happened.\r\n\n\n\nThe black broken edges of my vision came in more, the world sped up, and the room was no longer a room but a spinning vortex like a Mandala made from all the broken parts of reality. This was it, I thought, I'm not going any further and then BAM, neon colours fly past. Black then Colour, black then colour, black then colour flashing fast, I can't remember if they were closing and opening portals or just that I was smashing through each one. Neon colours so perfect they could not be manifested by anything I could dream up (I later remembered the sound that was lost on me when I first scribbled down my travelogue if you will; the sound was akin to electricity, imagine standing near a load of pylons and you can slightly hear the buzzing of the energy within, that! But more intense). Before I knew it I was in a black box, with edges generating pure colour and light at its edges, it feels like an old 80's game, there's no real detail anywhere. I fell like I've smashed through glass (That's what it looked like upon 'entry') but it didn't hurt, nothing hurt. This was intense, everything lasted seconds at a time but it was long enough for me to take in. \r\n\n\n\nAs I begin to look around (I'm not walking, sitting or standing, I'm just there, its like I didn't have a body any more, I was just... There? This was something I wasn't thinking about at the time) These strange but lovely faces crowded me; I can't see more then their love-filled, smiley, ecstatic faces! \r\n\n\n\nThese faces where manifested by fragile strands of neon strings of light; Green, Blue and Yellow. They smiled big smiles constantly, as if someone had carved a permanent state of joy across their beautiful faces. They had pointed ears and hair that defied gravity (If you could call it hair, as it was more like light particles flowing into the surroundings and being slowly enveloped by the darkness) every look they give me fills me with an energy I've never experienced before, and its at this moment I realize how weightless I am. They spoke at once, not the same 'words' or in unison more like when you get a group together and everyone has something different to say and cant wait for the next person to stop, it was pandemonium. I wish I took in how many there where. Every noise echoes and is so loud I could barely take it. Every face is so familiar, yet I am pretty sure I have never encountered these beings before, I feel like one of them at this point, sure I was one of them now I think back. \r\n\n\n\nI was colour and light in the darkness, the darkness swallowing all of that up. But that's fine. We have enough. \r\n\n\n\nWhile they make a certain contact with me, I finally feel I can move. The taste upon entry I realise was acidic, my spit turned thick, and I couldn't swallow, it felt as though I was wet with sweat and dribbling The taste upon entry I realise was acidic, my spit turned thick, and I couldn't swallow, it felt as though I was wet with sweat and dribbling, so I touch my head, I'm sure I'm covered in beads of sweat. This makes me feel embarrassed but the feeling of assurance washes over me. They were so concerned, elated and caring. They spoke in sounds that I could not understand, but I could feel what they were trying to disclose? Express? Impart? I felt every word in their dialect and I understood, they wanted me to be safe and wished to give me sustenance (even now that doesn't feel like the right word), they were wishing to make me 'more' of who I was, who I am. They hoped it all wasn't too much for me. And I was there, I felt like I was floating through space (The blackness swallowing the light these being where emitting) surrounding by friends and family I hadn't seen in so long. Their elation was really out of this world, I felt as if I had gone to a chaotic war zone, and come back safe, it's all I felt they wanted. \r\n\n\n\nI could have been dying, overdosing somehow or even dead but that didn't feel as though it mattered at all. I was awash with peace, love and serenity... if this was Nirvana I would not be surprised.  The whole event was so intense I almost panicked but those faces... They stopped that along with the sense that my partner was there, in everything, part of it all (a little overly romantic but that's how it was). My meeting with the apparitions was fleeting, as soon as I could grasp what was going on, the room came slowly back into focus, I could see the outlines of the posters, and I could see my hands grasping water on my lap as I sat upright on the bed (I had no idea I was sitting, that part of me was lost) but the colours are still floating through the room and the faces were more like ghosts. \r\n\n\n\nI'm still tripping even though I am back in the room, I can hear conversation now (but it sounds foreign) and a wash of euphoria engulfs me. All I can do is smile. I felt like nothing, but part of everything. This was happiness I had never experienced before, to be truly connected and accepted. They were so happy to see me and pulled me in and filled me with warmth infinite. I could have drowned in that. Those around me are slowly morphing into their human shells, and I am left taking in what had happened, so fast, so slow and sudden. \r\n\n\n\nI cannot thank our guru friend enough, as the world came into focus more one of the faded faces molded into his smiling human shell and I felt as if I was finally coming back to earth. Relief bittersweet. These two (my guru and my partner) were a great human alleviation to what I had just experienced. How fast and far had I traveled? The only way I could explain it would be as if I was an elastic band expanding slowly out and then super fastback to my original state. But that doesn't feel right.\r\n\n\n\nThe neon green curtain remained for a few minutes after the initial trip, I felt sick, travel sick, I was sure at this point I had just been sling shotted across dimensions at the speed of light, but I still found the travel sickness confusing (I did have Saveloy and chips a good few hours before) and I felt a red/pink feeling slime its way up my insides, our Guru is quick with a bin and water, but this throwing up feels excellent, like I was expelling all the pain and suffering that might have been there before, even if I didn't notice it breeding inside of me.  I've never felt so much at peace then at that moment, even while I'm writing this the veil still shrouds me. As I sobered up, the colours began to wash away, but I still felt weightless. It was like I've just experienced an intense orgasm, but really that doesn't even come close to how the whole experience felt. \r\n\n\n\nEven now as I write this; it's like they have cleansed me of all my physical and mental pain. I thought my partner had made it to the same place, I thought he could see what I saw, but he didn't. I felt him in everything though. It's such a shame that he only got to see the trip and not what I felt was the destination. He zoned out, but was still aware of this planet and maybe who he was, he didn't leave the room basically. \r\n\n\n\nMy mind definitely went somewhere and I feel as if my soul has been massaged from the very core. Thinking back it was akin to a Gas trip, the taste, the chaos. But much more spiritual, more personal and it felt less random. And unlike Gas, I'll be in line for when the next travel tickets are produced.\r\n\n\n\nI wrote this little over 24hours after the trip, I meditated on the sensations and found similes to better explain what I could remember. If our guru didn't hand me paper whilst I recounted the journey much of that would have been lost, I even did drawings, I would have forgotten a lot of what you have just read if it was not for that pad. I would have forgotten a lot of what you have just read if it was not for that pad.  If your ever going to take that trip, have paper by you, just in case you break through, you wont regret it. My hope is that I can try the lucid dreaming technique and maybe even one day venture further into the void. It doesn't matter if my trip could have been influenced, I don't believe it was, I could not think at all while this was happening, I was just there. \r\n\n\n\n Thinking back also I believe that very possibly this DMT could be attributed to finding complete enlightenment, if some monks can control certain muscles and parts of their body, what's stopping them from accessing that part of their brain, stimulating the Dimethyltryptamine and finding complete enlightenment? It's only one small theory of mine. All I know is that sinceSince the journey, my anxiety has faded and I am so at peace with the world.\r\n\n\n\nAnd why the title you ask? Well that's the rule with the Guru, when he makes a batch, the first one is always free..."

        "report_text": "This was my first experience with DMT. I decided to do a small-ish dose to get to know this magical substance before experimenting with larger doses. I obtained 250mg of this powder in an off-white/yellowish powder. I split it into 5 equal piles, then split one of those into two smaller piles. I eyeballed 25-30mg, but afterward I decided I really need a .001g scale to be more precise with this stuff (it\u0092s powerful!).\r\n\n\n\nMethod: I read up on various means of vaporizing DMT; I decided to go with the plastic bottle method for its cheapness and ease, and I have to say I\u0092m happy with it. I got one of those fat Gatorade bottles and cut off the bottom. I then used the cap and two sheets of aluminum foil and formed a bowl in the foil with the cap. DMT will run from the flame so the bowl is essential. This was is also nice as I could take my time vaporizing the powder/crystals with the cap on and fill the bottle completely before taking my hit. I took the whole bottle in one hit.\r\n\n\n\nMindset/setting: I\u0092m a busy grad student right now; I\u0092m just winding up the semester and figured with how short the trip is and the lack of hangover that I could do this on a Friday night with little consequence. I\u0092m a practicing Buddhist. I began prepping my room the day before by cleaning and organizing. I believe it\u0092s very important to have a welcoming space for doing drugs in based on experience. I have experience with MDMA, LSD, shrooms, 2C-B, xanax, and a lot of pot; DMT is a bit intimidating, so I broke my usual habit of diving into drugs head first and aimed for a smallish dose. I\u0092ve recently made personal breakthroughs in regard to self-compassion and surrendering to my experience instead of fighting it; this helped with engaging with the trip without fear, but I was certainly nervous. I built my rig for smoking at around 10pm and spend the next hour with light music and cleaned my room. Then, I created a nest with a couple blankets and my meditation cushion. I prepped the dose and loaded the device; I lit incense and a couple candles around my room, with one directly in front of me as I\u0092ve heard recommended to have a focal point as the trip comes on. I meditated for 20 minutes prior to dosing; I set an intention to surrender to the experience and not try to interact with any beings I may encounter, but just to share the space with them and try to be observant and peaceful. On the day of, I didn\u0092t have any other substances besides caffeine (chai) that I sipped through the morning and afternoon. I was effectively sober at time of ingestion. I had smoked half a pack of cigarettes (my first tobacco of any kind in three months) in the three days previous to the trip. I tossed the rest of the pack and saved one for post-trip contemplation.\r\n\n\n\nDosing: After my meditation, at 11:35pm, I felt ready to dive right in. I grabbed my rig and used the flame of a utility lighter to go around the outside of the bowl shape, thus hopefully vaping the powder evenly and preventing it from running (which would be more likely if I just held it dead center under the powder). The bottle filled with milky white smoke, and as soon as I was convinced I\u0092d vaped all the powder, I took one deep breath, exhaled, unscrewed the cap, and took the whole bottle full in one pull and held for approximately 10 seconds. The smoke wasn\u0092t too harsh, a bit plastic-y tasting, but nothing harsh enough to make me cough.\r\n\n\n\nTrip: All the sudden the fireplace in front of me with the candle placed in front of it stretches and is taking on an interesting geometric pattern. Geometric patterns take over my field of vision, then I start to contact the \u0091dome,\u0092 there are beings there. It is all quite intense. I pull out of it at one point for a sip of water, and go back. I\u0092m shifting between very bright, colorful geometric patterns twisting and whirring and a scene of colorful beings, lots a neon pink, lime green, navy blue, and gold. \r\n\n\n\nThe beings are riding bikes; the ones I remember most clearly are a couple that rides bike to an apartment complex and run inside together. They are cheerful and appear happy/carefree. At this point I need to lay down on the floor. My thoughts are going many places; the most prominent awareness is the intensity of this and the feeling that I\u0092m not quite in the right mindset/physical health to go much further with this substance right now.\r\n\n\n\nI begin to come down. It\u0092s all felt like a very, very concentrated acid trip. I go in and out with some geometric patterns. The fireplace and candle are still geometric, a calming and beautiful scene I made for myself. The collage on my wall is vibrant and warm; I get a brief moment of self-love. As I pull out more and more, I\u0092m very happy I took the size of dose I did. I am assured that I received good product and know how to approach DMT in the future. The whole thing is effectively over with some glowing at 11:43pm, approximately 8 minutes in total.\r\n\n\n\nI step outside and smoke my cigarette. I don\u0092t feel a whole lot different than I did before. This wasn\u0092t any spiritual awakening and I didn\u0092t gain much insight. It was a beautiful little introductory dose and I look forward to taking another ride.\r\n\n\n\nTakeaway: Overall, DMT is an extremely intense substance. The trip could be quite frightening, especially if my mental and physical health weren't strong. I found myself really feeling the impact of the few days of cigarettes on my body. I resolved to abstain from cigarettes and spend more time meditating and exercising before I approach this substance again (I\u0092m planning on at least a week before my second dose). \r\n\n\n\nI really want to \u0091breakthrough\u0092 and see what I can make contact with. The scenes I was immersed within were beautiful, cheerful. This substance has such mystical potential. I\u0092m still a bit intimidated but quite excited for more exploration."

        "report_text": "I was foolish. I'd just acquired some DMT and was impatient to try it. I didn't know for sure the purity of the substance I had acquired and instead of properly weighing a dose (I found I didn't have sensitive enough scales) I just tried to 'eyeball' it.\r\n\n\n\nI was at home in my apartment, a safe and comfortable setting, but I had had a difficult week, was tired and not in the most positive frame of mind. I really should have waited until another time. I really should have known better.\r\n\n\n\nI took the DMT by sandwiching it between two layers of dried mint leaves in the bowl of a glass bong. Filling the bong with smoke and taking it in one single hit which I held in as long as I was able to.\r\n\n\n\nI've read the following back to myself a couple of times and it doesn't really come close to describing what this experience was actually like, or how utterly overwhelming the feelings or terror and dread were. There are huge bits missing because I just don't know how to describe them, or quite where they fit in. But it's the best I can do.\r\n\n\n\nI lay back on my couch, waiting for something to happen. For a moment I thought I had failed to get a strong enough dose to experience anything, but very shortly I felt a warm 'glowy' feeling and started to perceive some interesting fractal-type visuals. However I was still very much in what I normally think of as reality at this point.  \r\n\n\n\nJust as I began to think that this was as far as this experience would go, things changed suddenly and drastically.  First, I felt my body instantaneously and completely disintegrate into an unknowable number of infinitesimally small particles. Then the walls of the room I was in rapidly expanded and blasted away. I knew I had broken through, I felt excited, happy and euphoric. I knew I had broken through, I felt excited, happy and euphoric. \n\n\n\nThis did not last.\r\n\n\n\nAs the walls of my room vanished away, I caught a glimpse of and was briefly inside of a vast purple coloured dome-like structure covered in fractal patterns. It felt like a beautiful and safe (if somewhat overwhelming) place to be. For some reason I tried to speak (I don't recall what I wanted to say, but remember saying 'cup', and being confused that this was not the word I intended), and I was instantly ripped away from it. Looking back, there was a clear sense that my being torn away was a direct result of my attempting to speak, although I didn't acknowledge this at the time.\r\n\n\n\nI'm not able to clearly recall what the 'place' I found myself in after that was like...I remember very briefly seeing the wall of my room again before a vertical white plane covered with a regular pattern of clearly defined black dots slammed across in front of it, from one side, then from the other side, and then closed in on me...what little visual experience I had after that was incomprehensible and indescribable. I remember seeing the dot planes a few more times, and know that I experienced other things in between seeing those, but am unable to recall those things in any meaningful way.\r\n\n\n\nThroughout all of this there was an overwhelmingly loud sound which continually got louder.\r\n\n\n\nI remember experiencing complete terror, and feeling that this was not at all the right place for me to be, that something was very, very wrong and that I had made an awful mistake in taking this journey. I believed, with no doubt at all, that I had died.\r\n\n\n\nI remember feeling that there was some kind of consciousness or entity in that place (although I never saw it), which it seemed had pulled me there and wished to keep me there. It wasn't exactly malevolent, but it seemed to be enjoying or benefiting from my fear in some way.\r\n\n\n\nAt this point I began to quickly forget how I had come to this place, then who I was, then what concepts like 'who', 'I' and 'where' even were, until 'I' no longer existed.\r\n\n\n\nThe thing that used to be me kept trying to speak, although it had no concept of what speech or language were or what it was trying to do or why. The other entity in this place seemed to be trying to devour and subsume the non-me into itself.\r\n\n\n\nAt this point I remember non-me feeling only two things: complete, dreadful, all-consuming terror, and a desperate desire to grasp hold of some kind of idea of what I now know as, but was COMPLETELY alien at the time, SELF.\r\n\n\n\nFor what was an unknowable amount of time; at once seeming like mere moments and at once an eternity; non-me struggled to grab a hold of an idea it did not understand. This was inscrutably difficult, initially non-me couldn't even conceive of what an 'idea' was, never mind develop a specific one. But eventually, after what felt like an eternity of desperate mental grasping, non-me was finally able with great effort to say a single word: \r\n\n\n\n'I'.\r\n\n\n\n'I'.\r\n\n\n\n'I'.\r\n\n\n\n'I'.\r\n\n\n\nI don't know how many times non-me said this before progressing to 'I AM' but it seemed uncountably huge.\r\n\n\n\n'I AM'.\r\n\n\n\n'I AM'.\r\n\n\n\n'I AM'.\r\n\n\n\nThis went on for a long, long while; my sense of self slowly returning. The entity (if there was such a thing) did not seem to wish me to leave, but also no longer appeared interested in trying to stop me.\r\n\n\n\nA rectangle appeared, and resolved into a calendar on my wall. Other familiar objects in my apartment resolved themselves one by one. I felt my body again. There were walls. A door. I was on a couch. \r\n\n\n\nHowever, everything was still distorted and I still did not know who or what I was.\r\n\n\n\n'I AM'....'I AM'...went on for some time until suddenly the epiphany came and I recalled my name...\r\n\n\n\n'I AM A****** J****!'...'I AM A****** J****!'      \r\n\n\n\nI was instantly back in reality, and realised that I was triumphantly screaming this out as loud as I possibly could.\r\n\n\n\nI felt confused and bewildered for some time after that; eventually I got up to look at my clock. It took me a while to recall what time was or meant, but once I did I could tell that this experience had taken roughly 15 minutes. It had felt like eternity.\r\n\n\n\nThe effects didn't fully wear off for another half hour, my vision being distorted and my thoughts dis-jointed, but mainly being 'I'm never fucking doing that again'.\r\n\n\n\nI felt confused and anxious for hours afterwards and barely slept that night.\r\n\n\n\nUltimately though, despite being horrible and not something I wish to repeat, I think this has been a positive experience. The main thing I have taken from this is a very strong sense of my own mortality The main thing I have taken from this is a very strong sense of my own mortality (and of how unaware I was of it before, despite thinking otherwise) and also a renewed feeling of how fortunate I am to have this existence, of who I am and of how glad I am to BE who I am. I've been taught a hard, harsh lesson and already have a strong sense that I will grow from it.\r\n\n\n\nI can't categorically say that this will be my last visit to hyperspace...I'm deeply intrigued by the dome-place I briefly saw before being taken away to...whatever that was. But I think that it will be a great many years before I feel mentally grounded enough to venture there safely, if I ever do. While I'm glad of what I experienced last night, I do not ever want to go to that...place...again."

        "report_text": "I have decided to write a trip report for reasons that are twofold.  For one, I do wish to warn others of some of the complications I experienced on this drug.  I have read many trip reports and done a lot of research, plus have personally experimented with it in the past, and I believe what happened to me is less common. I believe what happened to me is less common.  Second, part of my reason for writing this is selfish.  I desperately need a way to help integrate this experience to move forward with my life and I this is an attempt at doing just that.\r\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND:  I am a 33 y/o female who is quite experienced with psychedelics.  I really enjoy marijuana, LSD, mushrooms, Ketamine, MDMA, 2CB, combinations of the aforementioned substances, etc.  Prior to the experience I am about to share, I had smoked DMT approximately 15-20 times, but usually out of a vape pen which cuts me off before I can really get a 'blast off' dose if you will.  Some of those trips were really cool and some were scary, but never so frightening it turned me away from my pursuit of crystal DMT. I spent YEARS looking for it and 3 weeks ago, I finally found it.  My husband and I bought a gram and partook in a few small trips, working up the courage to take that 'blast off' dose.\r\n\n\n\nTHE SET UP:  4 days ago, at aprox 1500, we decided it was time to try to travel to another dimension and meet these 'entities' we keep hearing about.  I invited 2 of our friends over (K and P).  We used our rig to 'dab' the DMT. P went first and blew her 40 mg hit out immediately through her nose.  Accordingly she had a fun experience in which she was still able to communicate with us.  K went next and did a smaller dose and came back 10 minutes later sharing about all the amazing visuals she had seen and love she had felt. \r\n\n\n\nMy husband decided to go last, so, finally, the moment I had waited for, it was my turn.  My husband got the rig ready and poured in 40 mg of dimitri.  I inhaled it all and laid back on the couch.  Some Gramatik song was playing, I cannot remember which. As I held in the smoke, I closed my eyes and began to see hazy, dull, colors and patterns.  I thought to myself \"this isn't really working\" and let the smoke out.  I started to say to my husband I needed more (hah, yeah right) but I couldn't get it out.  What happened next is a it of a blur, but this is my best recollection:\r\n\n\n\nTHE TRIP: All of a sudden bright neon elaborate patterns, spirals, and jester-like clown people filled my vision. I was already terrified and could not understand what was going on.  It is difficult to find words in the English language to describe a true DMT trip, but this is the only way I can think to describe it:  It felt like one of the jester creatures grabbed me from behind and then grabbed my upper lip, stretching and pulling it over my head, turning my face inside out.  I found it difficult to breath.\r\n\n\n\nAt this point I was still laying down with my eyes closed. He (the jester felt like a male to me for some reason) then slammed me face first into the couch and then pulled me back up and tore both my eye lids open forcing me to take in the INSANE psychedelia before me.  My husband and friends said at one point, I bolted up to a sitting position with my eyes wide open, darting rapidly around the room.  I think this coincides with the feeling of having my eyes torn open and being forced to watch this horror unfold. \r\n\n\n\nThe words I was hearing in my head were \"you think you can play with us you little b****?\"  I couldn't understand what was going on or what I had done to get treated like this.  I don't even think I knew who I was, but I definitely knew something was horribly wrong. \r\n\n\n\nThe next thing I remember is feeling like this jester had stuck jagged plastic down my throat and I was choking to death.  Outwardly my husband and friends said I had started gagging and this is when they became concerned.  Looking back I am sure the taste of plastic and the harshness of the smoke is what led to this feeling but when you are that high you have zero ability to rationalize this.  The gagging turned into me spitting all over the couch and my husband said it looked like I was about to throw up.  Instead of throwing up I tried to stand up (according to my loved ones, who got me to sit back down) and began crying out \"help, help, help, help\" over and over.  The jester continued to choke me and I felt like I was loosing the battle.  I started saying \"I can't breathe, I can't breathe.\" \r\n\n\n\nFinally, the trip began to release its grip and I could hear voices that were familiar, but the most familiar voice I could finally hear was my own.  I heard myself begging for help and asking how to breathe. I heard myself begging for help and asking how to breathe. My husband said I even said \"help me YOU GUYS\" and he said that notified him that I was coming back because I had some concept that my loved ones were there.\r\n\n\n\nI slowly came out of it and as I was coming back that jester character was surrounded by beautiful colors and patterns and he was kind of dancing and smiling and laughing saying \"come again little girl.  We'll be waiting\" and other eerie stuff like that. When I finally, completely came to, I saw 3 very scared people surrounding me, rubbing my back, telling me I was ok and I was safe.  I had no idea why they were telling me this and I turned to my husband and said \"what's going on, what's happening to me?\"  He replied \"babe, you did DMT.\"  I began to cry.  The whole experience was only about 5 minutes, possibly less (which is short, even for DMT) I was later told.  It felt like a life time.\r\n\n\n\nTHE AFTERMATH: It is 4 days later.  The trip is very difficult to remember visually, but the feelings are not.  I can still feel that jagged plastic in my throat (I'm assuming I must have burned it or something).  I still feel sick to my stomach.  I still feel anxiety and fear.  I had to leave work early the other day and begged my husband to leave work too because I was anxious and scared and felt like the only safe place for me in this world was with him.  I sincerely feel traumatized.  The main entity I saw was MEAN; he was maniacal, taunting, violent and aggressive.  I feel like I am on the verge of a panic attack writing this out.\r\n\n\n\nMY TAKEAWAYS: When I started this I said I wanted to warn others.  And I don't mean about the intense hallucinations or entities.  I have heard of horrible trips and I did know it was possible, even likely.  I guess I didn't realize it could ever be THAT aggressive of a hallucination, but hey, it's DMT, anything can happen when you enter that realm.  I was in that entity's world and it had its way with me.  \r\n\n\n\nWhat I really want people to be mindful of is that DMT can be physically dangerous.  You always hearI always heard things like \"you're so high you can't keep your eyes open and you can't move, you just lay there.\"  Well news flash, I did both and I could have hurt myself trying to stand up like that if my friends and husband had not been there. I could have hurt myself trying to stand up like that if my friends and husband had not been there. I didn't read about people almost choking or throwing up on it until I started to research it after my experience, and even then there is not a lot of information on this side effect.  Perhaps because it doesn't happen often, but it CAN happen.   If you are going to do this drug,I would have a sitter.  Someone who can help you get sit back down or throw up, safely.  \r\n\n\n\nI won't ever touch this substance again and I probably won't consume any form of psychedelic until I am able to integrate this experience."

        "report_text": "The other night I had my first oral DMT experience. I am a very well rounded with use of psychedelics. I have taken \u0093heroic doses\u0094 of mushrooms many times. I am also very familiar with smoked DMT and LSD. \r\n\n\n\nThis was an experience like no other. I had done a lot of research on pharmahuasca prior to this experience. I had done a lot of research on pharmahuasca prior to this experience. I believe it is very important to do your research before you do something like this. Before the experience I had not eaten anything for 24 hours, my last meal was a steak bowl from Chipotle. I followed no strict diet the week before the experience. I ate as I normally did. \r\n\n\n\nMy wife was visiting her sister for the night so I was home alone for the evening. I took 3.5 grams of Syrian rue seeds and pulverized them into a fine powder with a coffee grinder. I then simmered the seeds in distilled water with juice from half a lemon in a stainless steel saucepan for 30 minutes. I continually stirred with a wooden spoon. I strained the liquid out through a t shirt into a bowl and simmered the leftover seed material for 20 minutes just as I had done with the first. I then strained off the second pull and combined the liquid together. I simmered the liquid and reduced it down to about a cup and half. I put it in the fridge to cool for couple of hours.\r\n\n\n\nAt 9:00 pm I ate a piece of dry toast and then slowly drank the liquid. It was kind of bitter but not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I then ate a second piece of toast. At 9:50 I put 150 mg of DMT freebase into a shot glass then added Pepsi cola and stirred until it was dissolved. I let it sit in the fridge for about 10 minutes. At this point I felt no nausea from the Syrian rue tea. I didn't feel anything really I wasn't sure that it was working. At 10:00 pm I drank the DMT Pepsi. \r\n\n\n\nAfter about 5 minutes I started to feel slightly weird so I went into my bedroom to lay down. It was slightly hard for me to walk. I lay down in bed and the ceiling was starting to sort of twirl. Then the walls in my peripheral vision would sort of curl up and all I could see was the white ceiling. I felt this was extremely strange I sat up and needed to purge and walked to the bathroom and purged. It was extremely hard to walk I was very impaired. I lie back down in bed and close my eyes. I see a box-like jaguar jumping on top of me. It looked like an Aztec statue. I opened my eyes and the walls in my room are green and moving. I think to myself whoa this is strong I look at the clock it is 10:15 pm. I close my eyes and I am amazed by beautifully designed fractals. I am also being bombarded by thoughts of my childhood and things in my life that I need to change. The fractals would keep getting more overwhelming as time went on and eventually I experienced ego death.\r\n\n\n\nI was in darkness until I was greeted by a skull-like head thing that opened its mouth and it replicated itself out of its mouth spiraling out into infinity (this might not make sense but I\u0092m not sure how else to explain it.). It communicated telepathically and said welcome to my playroom. I was suddenly looking at two screens mine and his we painted beautiful landscapes telepathically. I felt as I had been in the playroom before it was very familiar and seemed like I was supposed to be there. We painted these scenes for some time. It is hard for me to recall what the scenes looked like in detail but they were something like an other dimensional landscape. Eventually this time in the playroom ended and I was greeted by a second presence. It's hard to describe what he looked like but he was red and he was the father. I\u0092m not sure how I know he was the father but I did. He was terrifying and communicating with me in a strange clicking language. I had heard the language before on a strong penis envy mushroom trip. He was not happy with me I could tell. I was thrown back into my body and immediately felt horribly sick. I stumbled to the bathroom and purged so very violently but after I felt much better. I lay back down in my bed and close my eyes and leave my body once more.\r\n\n\n\nThis time I was confronted by the mother she was very comforting. She was a beautiful green and very dragon-like but not quite a dragon. She too was communicating with me in the clicking alien language I don\u0092t know what she was trying to say to me but it was good. Then I was once again confronted by the father. He and the mother were together. I started feeling really sick again I was aware of my body now but could not move. I telepathically said mother please relieve me of this. I received communication back and was told to chant. I did not know what this meant but decided to try it. Out loud I started to chant \u0093OH OH OH OH OH OH\u0094 It was the only thing I could vocalize. The mother and father's communication with me was insane the alien language was so much more complex than anything I have ever heard the alien language was so much more complex than anything I have ever heard. I was finally able to get up and purged again. I lay back down and I'm back in reality. I no longer feel sick and I was very happy I look at my phone and its now 11:25.\r\n\n\n\nThe whole thing lasted about an hour of out of body experience and the after affects lasted about 2 hours. The after affects were very pleasant. Listening to music was greatly enhanced. It would have probably all lasted longer if I had not purged so soon. I was starving because I had not eaten anything for so long so I ate some frozen chicken strips and drank a couple beers. I did not have any negative effect from the Syrian rue MAOI from eating. I watched some tv for a while then got a good night\u0092s rest. \r\n\n\n\nThe next morning I felt completely fine and happy. Something I think I should add, the colors of the visuals during this journey were very dark earth tones. Overall it was a really good experience and I would do it again. I hope that someday I will return to the playroom."

        "report_text": "Intro:\r\n\nEver since I was 15 years old I discovered drugs. I made a list off what seemed interesting. I soon discovered psychedelics, drugs that open the mind to new perspective, I made a list of what I would want to use and what not. I added DMT to my list of do\u0092s but was careful with it. I knew I could not just use DMT without preparation, and wisdom gained from lesser psycho-active drugs. I was only 15 years old and the id scared me.\r\n\n\n\nFor 6 years I grew used to the altered mind psychedelic drugs force on me. I started with Marijuana, then next Psilocybin mushrooms. I used them twice and lost control once. I knew I was not ready I still felt scared. Last year I used LSD once, a low dose. I controlled it. So I knew it was time and I was exited to the id of using DMT.\r\n\n\n\nSo in the Summer off 2013 when I was 21 years old I visited a good friend who had made me n-n-DMT himself. It wasn\u0092t pure, he said about 70% DMT and 30% chemical residue. He has been my friend for over 10 years so he told me the risks truthfully and said \u0093 so how about it?\u0094 I got scared and thought to myself, wait what you mean NOW?!\r\n\n\n\nNOW he said. He told me he tried using it himself but he has weak lungs. He couldn't hold the DMT smoke in lung enough to break through but he knew my lungs could take a lot more. He was right. I asked him should we go outside to a park? He looked at me with a frown and said: \u0093You sure you know what DMT will do to you? You won\u0092t be able to walk at all\u0094 I didn\u0092t really comprehend what that meant. I figured it was like being really high. So I asked him should I light a joint during the DMT trip? Again he frowned and said \u0093My friend, you won\u0092t be able to do anything at all. You\u0092ll be gone mate, gone from earth.\u0094 In retrospect I don\u0092t think I knew what that meant.\r\n\n\n\nThe room I was in was a student dorm, a small one maybe 10 square meters, his room was decorated with psychedelic art and classy paintings. He played the Sacred Spirit album from his laptop and dims the light. I got really nerves and to be truthful more then a little scared. He told me \u0093Take three hits, full hits; keep it in your lungs for as long as you can.\u0094 So I asked him for the pipe. He told me \u0093No I\u0092ll hold it you just hit it, now go sit on the bed you\u0092ll fall down.\u0094 So that's what I did. \r\n\n\n\nHe took the pipe (most junky pipe I have ever witnessed in my life, it was a homemade plastic crack pipe). I looked at him and said seriously? He filled it with over 50mg of DMT excluding the residue that was still in the pipe and pre-heated it. Smoke was coming out now and I was nerve-racked. \u0093Hit it\u0094 he said. \r\n\n\n\nOnset:\r\n\nSo I leaned closer and took a hit for over 3 seconds. The smoke was in my lungs for only 2 seconds and it hit me like a bulldozer. It tasted and felt terrible! The worst smoke I have ever had in my life. Like plastic burning in my lungs. I started to hallucinate heavily. Eyes were opening in the curtains, the wall started to vibrate. I could hear my friend say \u0093one more time\u0094 but I couldn\u0092t see him. His voice was heavily altered like it was being played though a computer and being played with. The pitch was lower and it was like he talked in slow-motion. So I hit it again. This time I was starting to get really dizzy and heavy. A faint noise was starting to arise in the room much like sound distortion. I felt like I had trouble breathing now and starting sweating. I couldn\u0092t hear the music anymore and could barely see anything. But the sound distorting was getting louder. I knew I didn\u0092t have long. \u0093One more time\u0094 he said. So I took a third hit\u0085. And fell. I could hear him say.. \u0093One more time\u0094 and with all the strength I could muster I answered \u0093No.. Enough..\u0094 But it was like I to spoke in slow-motion. The Sound distorting was embracing me like a mother embracing her child. I felt\u0085 Strange. The Sound distorting was embracing me like a mother embracing her child. I felt\u0085 Strange. I didn\u0092t comprehend what was happening to me.. What is this.. Where am I, What happened..  I asked all the When, Why, What and how questions.. I could still feel my body sweat, and it felt like my nose was bleeding but I couldn\u0092t move and slowly it was like I could feel the DMT move though my body and everywhere it came it killed me, it was cold. I couldn\u0092t feel my arms at first. Then I couldn\u0092t feel my legs and lastly I couldn\u0092t feel my heart and breathing. \r\n\n\n\nComing Up:\r\n\nI was alone in my mind and there was nothing but my thoughts.. Thoughts I thought.. Must be what death is like.. Am I.. Dying?! Wake up, please wake up, please wake up!.. I didn\u0092t.. I tried waking up for what felt like an hour.. No good. Did.. I become my friend's experiment? Did he kill me? No, having a corpse in his bed would get him in serious trouble. Then I must have accidentally took too much.. Yes that's it I took too much DMT. I am the first person dying on DMT. What a waste.. There is so much I wanted to do with Life.. Sure I wasn\u0092t always grateful for life but.. did I want to die.. No. \r\n\n\n\nHm.. whats that? A voice.. \u0093You idiot!, You are dying!, You took too much!, What would your parents say!, there is a girl in your house expecting you to come home tomorrow and know what? You\u0092ll never see her again! You will never have anything but your thoughts.\u0094\r\n\n\n\nBut I tried everything. I tried waking up.. Lets give up? Fine let this be my end. My life would have been brief but I lived my life the way I wanted to. I had a good life. \r\n\n\n\nThe breakthrough: \r\n\nIt felt like my conscious was being lifted from my dead body, and sent at light speed though the universe. I kept going and going and going for what seemed like years. And then there was this dark place. And I had no physical form, I was the shattering of my ego. thousand of pieces floating in space.. My memories, my feelings, my ego. I played a piece of my memories. I relived it like it was happening at that very moment. I was a little boy walking to my mother on a sunny day. I was happy and wanted to be embraced with the love of my mother. It felt like I was starting to cry but there was no body to cry with. I relived moments of my life. My first kiss, meeting my first friends. Being bullied, my first fight. I felt.. everything.\r\n\n\n\nI started to get control over my shattered ego floating in space. My first thought was not where am I but when am I. I am no believer of reincarnation but it felt like this is where souls go to wait for rebirth. And I felt a presence. I felt he felt that I could feel his presence (it felt like a him not a her). I wanted to meet him and instead of moving through space, space moved around me and I started going forward. \r\n\n\n\nWhat I encountered next was beautiful. A floating ball of light. It was huge! like a red giant in comparison to planet earth and it made colors and shapes with its tentacles of light. A floating ball of light. It was huge! like a red giant in comparison to planet earth and it made colors and shapes with its tentacles of light. Millions of tentacles of light going everywhere. I saw colors and shapes I had never witnessed before. It was profound. Tentacles started going my way to my shattered ego. And when it touched me I learned all the secrets of existence. Imaged flashed in my head: Space, Men, Alien, Gas, Colors, Murder, Sex, TV, Propaganda, The news, Pain and suffering, Technology, the past, the present and the future. The formula, the math behind existence became mine. And I realized all that is, is but perspective in an infinite large universe. I am god and I am men, I am the devil and I am the saint. All that I see and all that I feel is but my perspective. If men and woman will ever live together in peace we must understand that all that we feel is but perspective. Our greatest enemy is our ignorance. We kill and hurt because we don\u0092t understand. These people we kill and hurt are not bad, they are different. They have a different perspective. Western society has thought me prejudice, has taught me so called good and wrong. But they are just one of many perspectives in the universe. And maybe, just maybe no one is right, not even me.\r\n\n\n\nComing Down:\r\n\nI started to hear music and chanting. I could feel my body become whole again and slowly I could feel the sweat on my face and the pain in my lungs. I opened my eyes and could see the eyes on the curtain stare at me. I felt very light and started to speak \u0093water...\u0094 A man sat next to me, he was chanting and appeared to make a sign in the air almost like he was conjuring up magic. His face was covered in a mask of light and color. it seemed familiar. He gave me water and kept chanting. His long blond hair was swirling it fascinated me, just like his chanting and signs. I drank... It felt good. The memories of my breakthrough started to come to me, I lay down on the bed and smiled I felt great. I traveled and found truth. I could already feel it changed me forever.\r\n\nA familiar voice: \u0093Are you OK? How was it?\u0094 He calmly asked. I was back.\r\n\n\n\nAfter Effects:\r\n\nI am one of you. A perspective in this increasingly mad and dangerous world. But I hate no longer, hate is for the unloved and the unnatural."

        "report_text": "I took the DiPT on an almost empty stomach and followed with a light meal. Despite this the onset of the chemical only began at the 1:00 mark in contrast to a previous trial where the effects had been evident within the first 1/2 hour and fairly developed by 1:00. I also have to say that the comeup of this dose was far more noticeable than my previous 30mg which really crept up on me. The response was quite a bit stronger than the previous trial and the mental aspect was at times psilocin like. I'm typing this at the 12th hour and I'm completely cleaned out, aside from a mild headache caused by dehydration and anorexia which is interesting considering I had no issue managing sustenance with 30mg.

I lay back and chill with my eyes closed listening to music on my sound system in lowlight and I notice CEV's crawling in a bit, akin to what I get when I close my tired eyes after a long night of cannabis. Small wisps of purple, blue and red colour collect together in strands and form a simple would-be wooden chair, the outline of of Adolf Hitler is drawn out by the wisps and it zooms in on his face; it's entertaining but I open my eyes because it's a rather hollow-barebones vision, if I'd even call it that. There's no OEV worth mentioning. Go back to manipulating the music and talking to friends on IM and IRC.\r\n\n\n\nT+2:30\r\n\nEffects ramp up quickly and I notice the sensation in the inner ear, I pay little attention to it and it pays little attention to me. Audio effects are far more bizarre than 30mg, music is still very interesting and dynamic so listening pleasure is not reduced but enhanced mostly because of the way audio actually affects you on this chemical. Sounds have impact, you pick up everything and you pick it up a lot differently than you do sober or on other chemicals; it's really a very different thing that I have never found with anything else. Musically, harmony still seemed to retain itself in some bizarre way amongst the drastic shifts in sound that took place but there was definitely some objective destruction of actual tonal relationships. There was BIG re-timbre-ing of sounds, including my own voice which had some dusty-vibrato attached to it that I cannot describe adequately, my brother sounded like the local bridge troll and his voice seemed to boom. The shift to the DiPT zone is pretty much complete and I've settled in (or out?) nicely. (++)\r\n\n\n\nT+3:30\r\n\nI've been enjoying myself, and having some wild conversations with friends that's putting me in a good space. This stuff pumps out awesome euphoria and a very concise stream of thought. (in contrast to psilocin in my experience) I am more or less at the peak so I decide it's an apt time to introduce DMT as I've been compelled to ever since I first tried DiPT. I put on a selection of Mount Kimbie tracks and load 22mg of DMT into my rig that's dedicated to the chemical. I vape the DMT and hold it in until it kicks in, on exhale and a breath in the room shifts into new zones of DMT that were certainly distinct from it standalone. The music becomes even more bizarrely shifted and 'confident' in itself (can't explain) and the bass from my subwoofer translates itself into a enveloping vibration/sensation that almost felt like a 'bass-entity'. The ceiling spins like clockwork to the music, the paint trip tiling on my roof becomes a fractal mosaic of tree-like appendages that twirl and coil into and out of themselves. My room becomes awash in purples, blues and reds as I'm sucked into CEV. This was not a breakthrough, nor was I attempting for one. However, the CEV response was so strong that it may as well have been. The CEV was perceived within the entirety of my human anatomy, the human silhouette. I can only really explain this as if you had a photosensitive membrane lining the inside of a hollow 3D model of me. Here is what followed.\r\n\n\n\nI closed my eyes and all I could see was my bottom row of teeth, the left rear molar vibrant red and the right rear molar violet with the remaining spectrum comprised in the teeth that lie in between. As the DMT hit completely a pulse was sent from left to right that rang each tooth in a descending note like a smooth drag across a large metallophone. There was no release after each tooth was 'struck' so a chord-like effect was created, a really beautiful sound. After all the notes rang my body was filled with the forms of two opposing entities. One was female, blue on the left and the other male, red on the right. With massive energy they swirled and chased each other within me until they balanced each other's size and position in such a way that their faces touched at the lips, a kiss. When they kissed their blue and red alignments met and a purple beam, or river shot out with a sound of some sort of alien-spectral acceleration. I felt an immense upward sensation that seemed to yank all of my being upwards to the direction of the river. \r\n\n\n\nI followed the purple beam inside me and it began to create the outline of a man. The man was the Hermetic idol, Hermes Trismegistus. I heard a sort of throat singing in the background that was not part of the music I had been listening to, although the being didn't seem to produce the song it was coming from him, certainly. He held an ankh in his left hand an old book in his right. I felt a supreme connection of thought and being with the form, and my vision zoomed in on the vibrant purple outline of his face. His expression was a frown and a smile at the same time, he was the portrayal of the ultimate duality of man and held the visage of pure hypostatic union just like the Pantocrator of Jesus that is found in St. Catherine's Monastery. The proverbial hermaphrodism of man personified in this epic chimera of a being, it was so pure and resolute. (++++). We held gazes and there was a mass relay of message and understanding that I simply cannot detail here. After this, I was in awe and incredibly humbled by his form and and energy along with the opportunity to be a conduit for such an experience. My awareness, my perception passed perfectly through his face so my 'eyes' passed directly through his, and then they opened. Residual DMT visuals whisping the room, the soon subside. This was the most resounding psychedelic experience I've ever had, it will stay with me forever in perfect memory.\r\n\n\n\nIt's worth noting that I have been having issues with my lower jaw being out of alignment, post the DMT experience it seems as if this has been cured or at least suspended even as I'm typing here the morning after. I won't speculate anything, but I know my own body. A change occurred.\r\n\n\n\nT+4:00\r\n\nTime is heavily distorted after the DMT comes out, there actually appears to be a few hiccups in time where the music and my own thoughts would slow to a halt for a millisecond, speed up slightly to make up for it and then return to normal DiPT sound-work. Despite this my timeline is sound in hindsight because I have the logs of conversation I had online with friends. I feel quite stimulated afterwards as well. I am still absorbing what has happened, it was so much to take in. DMT is always a lot to take in, but with DiPT it was an entirely new ballpark; the two interacted on an unbelievable scale of sound and vision. I put on some soothing instrumentals and kick back, basking in the immense sound and sensations therein. (+++)\r\n\n\n\nA few hours pass and I begin to level out a bit, mental effects and euphoria die down to low levels and I take a couple pulls of cannabis from my Rooster Apparatus to bring in some different sound. Cannabis adds a new spectrum of distortion and timbres to DiPT, it's just a little more wild and unorganized, a much wider phaser. After Cannabis, like my previous experiment; I notice a shift in gustatory and olfactory sensation. I notice a shift in gustatory and olfactory sensation. My saliva is metallic and sweet at the same time, cannabis smoke tastes and smells sugary with a metallic tinge so that's probably what flavoured my saliva. It's not unpleasant, just bizarre. For some reason I don't explore food even though I should have as I was quite hungry, I also do not hydrate appropriately during these few hours. Like aforementioned I also didn't make it outside like I had wanted. -Too distracted by effects, I paid for the lack of sustenance it with a headache. I did, after succumbing to the head-pain eat and drink appropriately. (++)\r\n\n\n\nT+7:00 \r\n\nA couple of friends are getting together and I decide I'm at a good level and I'd like to go out with them, I call up J and his voice is dropped with a fluttering timbre I chalk up to the phone. J and T come pick me up and we go to T's house and hang out with his girlfriend and D. For a short while everyone's voices are still a little ogre-ish but it begins to drop out very quickly. Within the next hour I am completely cleaned out of DiPT's effects, I am exhausted by the day but feel amazing about the experience. No residue in the ears unlike my 30mg trial, worth noting. (+)\r\n\n\n\nT+10:00\r\n\nJ and I trek back to his house and smoke some cannabis and eat some pizza. I feel only the cannabis as DiPT has not left a trace of itself by this hour. A few hours after I fall asleep. I sleep well, but it's dreamless. I normally dream very vividly but after an intense psychedelic experience my dreams are usually blocked from me, probably for ease of mind and resting purposes. \r\n\n\n\nI woke up about an hour ago, it' currently 8:30AM (T+20:30) and I've no residual effects whatsoever, ears are totally normal. A fantastic experiment and experience. Will be repeating at the same levels."

        "report_text": "I watch the powder melt into a puddle and then to a faint white vapor in the bulb of my freebase pipe. It doesn't look like much, but when I breathe in, the pipe lights an opaque white and doesn't fade until I stop my drag. I hold the hit, and patterns are already flitting on my dresser and desk and in the corner of my eye, as I look around my lightless bedroom which I\u0092m alone in. I can tell that this hit alone won't suffice, and I start to vaporize the DMT again. As I take my second hit, the patterns enhance rapidly and the glass bulb of the pipe steadily shrinks and expands like a balloon. This is it. I quickly set the pipe to my side before I'm unable to. The patterns around my room converge on me and consume my consciousness. I'm no longer counting the seconds to holding my breath. I'm not in my room anymore, but where I am, I don't know. \r\n\n\n\nIt's dark and congested with thoughts like a ball of knots that I'm tasked to untie. Nothing quite makes sense. It's all a riddle half-solved. I grasp for comprehension, but the futility becomes nauseating to the umpteenth degree. Whatever it is I'd done to wind up in this tornado of incomprehensible thought, I wish now that I hadn't. On a dark wet street corner, I see my mother and sister standing. The sight of them aches in me the way love does when it's far and out of reach and all there is to hold onto is a memory. Then the thought drops out into the abyss, and I'm left with a feverish desire for what I've already forgotten. \r\n\n\n\nI taste, for a moment, numerous tiny metallic pellets rolling all along my tongue like space candy I can't swallow. Then they too vanish. I taste, for a moment, numerous tiny metallic pellets rolling all along my tongue like space candy I can't swallow. Then they too vanish. A voice is calling out amongst the chaos for my attention and I'm finally able to discern it from the hodgepodge of sensory overload. As if all in one syllable, it tells me it will show me an image to make sense of what's happening, so pay close attention. Then, as if somebody flicked the switch on a Viewmaster, an image appears of a rainbow-striped smile-and-eyes like wet spaghetti noodles. I try to make sense of it, but the face means nothing to me, and I grow terrified because I understand now that I'm helplessly falling apart in every sense of the word. Still, I'm desperate to gain an understanding. The voice comes to me again, telling me to prepare myself because here comes the image, and there it is, the same jester-like smile that I realize now is simply toying with me, and then again it's gone. Anxiety and humiliation consume me like I'm a school kid stuttering at the front of the classroom, and the only way out is to book it-- only here I can't run. I'm a cow being prodded to the slaughterhouse without a clue as to what's going on except to know I should be very afraid. I quit! I surrender! But still the agony doesn't relent, and deeper grow the roots of primal fear. It's not as if I'm physically dying. My body isn't being destroyed. No, it's far, far worse than that. The ghost of my being-- my everything-- is evaporating and I'm slipping to nothing at all. Black hole. I'm done.  \r\n\n*** \n\nEverything calms and slows like a pinwheel submitting to gravity, and I find myself in an infinite chandelier-ocean of dazzling dark pink fractals extending into and through me all as one and like a flash of light, I feel love. Four beings are in front of me, staring at me with concern as I lie curled, trembling. These creatures take an amorphous shape, and I can only depict them from the fractal space around them because they have an aura about them, an undeniable life force creating an un-seeable seam between what is them and what isn't. If these creatures want to skin and eat me, by all means, they can, as I shrink tighter in my fetal position, petrified, paralyzed, and still in surrender to my own disintegration. \r\n\n\n\nTelepathically, they assure me that I'm all right now, and with a hint of annoyance, they remind me that what I'd experienced was necessary for me to arrive here, and they're right. I had done this before; I knew what I was in for. Then again, one can never truly brace for ego death, at least at this speed. I'm thinking next time I'll buy my ticket for the ayahuascan cruiseline. I've had my fill of the mach-ten space shuttle in smokeable form. The fear is still pulsating, and I want them to know it, but when I tell them, words don't form in my mouth. Rather, the feeling transfers to them, raw and unabbreviated. There is no way of sugarcoating it, no need explaining it with tongue twisted metaphors, no desperate search for the perfect words in a deep vernacular sea. It's simply given, pure and true. They're able to muster a bit more sympathy to comfort me, but I'm embarrassed now like the drunk high schooler at a party, neck deep in a toilet bowl as people hand him water and rub his back while he wonders if he's still cool.    \r\n\n\n\nOne of the creatures before me moves across the fractal space like a current through water and grabs a piece of paraphernalia, then he and another creature continue past me. The two don't have much interest in me. They pass behind me, I assume to become intoxicated on whatever alien compound they'll consume through their paraphernalia. I realize now that I must be in what I can best fathom is a trans-dimension-hookah-lounge-- a hangout of sorts. How these beings came to this space, I don't know. I wonder whether they're of this dimension, or if they've come from elsewhere as I have and that I appear in the same physical composition to them as they do to me; that the physical structure of this realm is a medial plane for inter-dimensional beings to coexist. \r\n\n\n\nFaced with the two remaining entities, I can sense their empathy more than the others. These two have a particular interest in me. They see me fully, past my frail ego into the seed of my soul. There is no longer an instinct for me to conceal myself and hide. There isn't fear or a feeling of being ostracized: no reason for vulnerability. I trust these beings, whom now I see to be a couple,-- a male and a female. It's profound. \r\n\n\n\nIt isn't profound in a way like the tickling feeling of falling in love. It\u0092s nothing like staring out at the ocean with the tide sliding over your toes and realizing the vastness of the universe. Rather, beings are gazing infinitely deeper into me as I stare into them, and it's as if the floodgates of our souls have been lifted so everything that is me can be sensualized and experienced by them, and everything that's each of them is flowing into me without reserve, and they into each other. We use no strategic nor deceptive tactics in our communication, nor do we offer any timidity. By this shameless trusting we unsheathe ourselves and stare endlessly at the unadulterated essence that we are. There is nothing in all of existence that could be more beautiful than these two beings radiating love with me. I had catapulted myself out of a rocket-fueled cannon through space and time at a speed faster than light, shedding every last layer of my ego, to wind up in this infinite fractal parlor sharing the everything of my being with two pure and eternal souls. \r\n\n\n\nThere's never a moment of bliss where anxiety isn't crawling around its underside because when happiness reaches its apex, it soon descends. But not here. In this place, I couldn't go and find happiness, just as I couldn't go and find water if I were scuba diving. There's no way getting to it or around it. I\u0092m in it. I breathe it. I taste it. I feel it on my skin. Naturally, anxiety isn't here. Instead of finding a reason for concern, I float and let the ecstatic plane wash me clean. \r\n\n\n\nAfter a moment of forever, I feel something. It's faint but it grows like a light in a crevasse of my mind coaxing me back to life. I don't scurry deeper into the dream world nor do I try climbing out of it. I just remain cozy and content as reality gently lifts the covers off of me and rocks me back awake. These remaining moments stretch on longer and longer like when ten minutes before a morning alarm feels like twenty minutes, then forty, and then an hour. As I fade from the wonder-world, I make a promise to myself and to the two beings. I swear never to reduce them to fabrications of a dream state, to hallucinations. They're my dear, eternal friends. They've shown me the most divine thing I've ever seen, and it's inside of me, inside of them, inside of you. They gave me a gift that no human ever did. How couldn't I love them? \t\r\n\n\n\nI open my eyes in a realm where natural sight is foreign for a moment. I close them again in what I already know to be a futile attempt to reenter the fractal galaxy one last time. I accept its end and smile. \"Oh my god,\" I say aloud in an awe-stricken finale. Bliss deflates when I hear the sound of my words. They're as rudimentary as a beeping microwave or the revving of an engine in contrast to the divine communication I'd just achieved."

        "report_text": "Following a few hours of screening and getting acquainted with the MRI, I had two full DMT study days at the Imperial College's Hammersmith Hospital in London, as a participant in some cutting edge brain imaging neuroscience research conducted by researchers at Imperial College London. The two study days were a week apart (a slot came available earlier than originally planned, and it was a big help to the Imperial guys with my being able to be flexible). I abstained from intoxicants a week prior to the study day. I was initially invited to participate in the pilot DMT-EEG study via a friend who is paying for the MRI scanning sessions, and I had the opportunity to participate in this study due to other study participants moving about in the scanner and giving poor quality data as a result.\r\n\n\n\nOn the study day, on arrival at the hospital, I meet with the head neuroscientist whose study it is, another researcher working with him, and the medical doctor who will be injecting me with the DMT (high purity synthetic DMT fumarate) and placebo (saline). I wash my hair in preparation for the EEG skullcap being fitted, while completing a number of questionnaire surveys on a laptop. Electrodes are attached to a number of places over my scalp via a gel that soon solidifies. I'm wired up to the EEG and shown how sensitive it is to noisy data (essentially if the face isn't relaxed). So one needs to be relaxed and very still while undergoing the DMT experience in the MRI for high quality data to be produced. I'm fitted with an injection port in my arm to allow for easy IV injection of DMT and placebo. I have good rapport with the Imperial team and feel like I'm in good, safe hands. I've met the leading neuroscientist running the study a number of times, he's a great chap.\r\n\n\n\nThere are four EEG and fMRI brain scanning sessions...two with DMT (in the medium and high dosage range), two with saline placebo, and I don't know which order I'll be receiving the dosages in. It was good to have been acquainted with the MRI environment prior to any dosing. My upper body is confined to the MRI tube, and my head is secured. For the quality of both the EEG and MRI data, it is imperative I cannot and do not move. I have eye shades on while being scanned, with eyes closed. The scanner is really quite noisy, but despite the noise and the confined, restricted space, I quite quickly start to feel comfortable in there.\r\n\n\n\nI was really quite nervous prior to my first dosing. Prior to my first scanning session I gave a urine sample for a drug test to make sure I was clean. I was fitted into the bed in the scanner and it was made sure I was secure. My head was locked in and I was fitted with ear plugs and ear defenders. Eye shades were placed over my eyes and I was loaded into the scanner. Anxiety levels were increasing. I communicate with the study lead through an intercom. He plays a recording of \"You are receiving the dose now\" and I select my preferred volume over the sound of the baseline scan of my brain. Following the scan, it is time for the dosing. I know that dosing is now imminent, and I'm pretty nervous and my heart is pounding. I receive my dose, and nothing happens. Going on from previous experience in the DMT-EEG pilot study, I know it would only be a few seconds before I start feeling the dose if it was DMT. I'm able to relax, knowing I will not be receiving the dose now. I think this worked quite well, as with more time spent in the MRI scanner, the more comfortable I got being in there.\r\n\n\n\nI fill out a variety of questionnaire surveys and we have lunch. Another member of the Imperial team I know comes to pay me a visit with his baby. This is nice and has a soothing effect on my nerves. We head back in the scanner. A little nervous as I know I will be being dosed for sure now. I personally don't enter the DMT space lightly these days...it is not really a \"love n' light\" experience for me I personally don't enter the DMT space lightly these days...it is not really a \"love n' light\" experience for me, but rather something much more serious and imposing in tone, if not outright menacing in tone. I'm wired up and loaded in the scanner, with a panic button on hand, and I'm talked through a body scanning session to help relax me. This time around, I will provide an intensity rating every minute. The study lead starts asking me my intensity rating (0 being no effect, 10 being the most intense drug effect imaginable), so I know dosing is imminent. I hear the dosing notification recording, and prepare for blast off. Within in a few seconds there is a distinct shift and expansion of perception behind closed eyelids...the contrast changes dramatically, a silvery screen comes into focus, and from this geometric patterns of extraordinary beauty and order condense and coalesce and link up in the space of just a few seconds. At the same time, I become aware of this feeling of heat or warm energy in both of my hands (something I experience repeatedly on mushrooms and other psychedelics and cannabis, and sometimes while deeply relaxed or meditating). This is a pleasant sensation, and for some reason it reassured me, I knew I was going to be ok, and relaxed and surrendered completely to the experience. \r\n\n\n\nIt takes me a minute following dosing to peak interestingly. At minute 1 I'm at a 7, minute 2 I'm at an 8, by minute 3 I'm already on my way back! A very fleeting and fast moving experience. The geometric visual architecture I'm witness too is outrageously beautiful. I remember coppery, bronzey metallic colours, navy blue and some neon pink in the centre of my vision during the peak...in the centre of my vision, it was like there was a light shining into the visual realm, illuminating what I was seeing and splitting up the spectrum of colours to produce a resplendently coloured but localised pool of constantly undulating colours. As the intensity of the peak wears off and I start to come back, I feel in a serene afterglow state, and I nearly tear up in gratitude for having the opportunity to experience something so amazing. I completely relaxed into the remainder of the experience, and I realise the anxieties I'd carried were misplaced. \r\n\n\n\nI should mention that IV DMT is a very smooth ROA, and I much prefer it to vaping. The transition to DMT space I found was smoother and less jarring than vaping it, and due to this smooth entry to DMT space, it seems to change the tone of the experience. I imagine at higher dosages things are likely to be more jarring, given how efficient this ROA is, and I\u0092m not really condoning it, as I was injected with medical grade DMT by a medical doctor, it was a nice way to fly though!\r\n\n\n\nFollowing the experience I am interviewed in detail about the content of my experience, and find I can recall a fair bit (certainly a lot more than by subsequent high dose experience). I then complete a number of questionnaire surveys to assess my experience in different ways, before having a shower to wash the EEG gel out of my scalp (remnants of which remained in there for a week), I say goodbye to the study lead and head home.\r\n\n\n\nFor the second study day, things were reversed, in that I got the DMT dose in the morning MRI scanning session, and the placebo for the intensity rating study. For the afternoon placebo session, even without being dosed, I was definitely in an altered, pre-hypnogogic state in the scanner. It makes me curious as to whether the very powerful magnets of the MRI could affect the brain in some way...but I see pink light pulsing in waves, and my imagination and memory recall is unusually vivid. I feel deeply relaxed in there, despite it being confined and it being so noisy, and I feel on the verge of sleep. Following this I am interviewed and complete more questionnaire surveys. \r\n\n\n\nMy second DMT dose for the morning scanning session was a fair bit higher, and I could tell this within a few seconds of being injected with it. There was a dramatic change in contrast, accompanied by a very powerful feeling of acceleration or expansion There was a dramatic change in contrast, accompanied by a very powerful feeling of acceleration or expansion, as I entered the DMT space. I encounter similar very beautiful, very ordered geometric visual patterning, but this time much more expansive and all encompassing, and much fast moving. I recall this experience being one of supreme order and supreme chaos...two opposites...at the same time. This was a more imposing experience given its intensity compared to the first, lighter dose. I have to say, I rather enjoyed the MRI scanner setting! Despite being cramped and restricted in movement, despite the incredible noise, it was experienced as a positive setting for a DMT experience in my case, and really didn't detract (one of my friends who took part in this same study thought the same). The interaction of the loud and highly repetitive and rhythmic MRI scanner sounds was interesting, and had a big effect on the visual aspect of the experience...what I was hearing really seemed to cross over with what I was seeing, and at the peak it was hard to know which was which. The experience was longer than the previous one, but a fair bit harder to recall afterwards. On my re-entry I experienced the same feelings of gratitude, and feelings of love and empathy for the special people in my life. Despite the power and speed of the geometries I was moving through, I never forgot that I was part of a scientific study (apparently some other participants did forget this), and I remained absolutely still for the duration. I was commended for this by the researchers, who stated that I would be in the front of the queue should Imperial conduct brain imaging research with 5-MeO-DMT..  \r\n\n\n\nOne of the final questions I was asked in the surveys was to rate to what degree I thought the experience could be explained as the effect of a drug on the brain, and to what degree I thought I was interacting and experiencing something outside or beyond myself. During the experience itself, I may have been more inclined towards the latter, but once I was back, I rated more highly on the \"drug effect on brain\" scale...while actually being in the DMT space can be so real, so vivid and so convincing at times, when I'm back down and my mind folds back in on itself to conform to this reality, my sceptical walls go back up with it. From this sober vantage point it seems more likely to me that the DMT experience is some very beautiful and mysterious aberration of brain function...not that I feel that detracts from its majesty really, given how mysterious and complex and amazing human brains are.\r\n\n\n\nSo there you have it. An experience I feel tremendous gratitude for having had the opportunity to have, and great to see scientific research on psychedelics start to expand into interesting new areas, and great also to encounter some really great people involved in this. Not something I shall ever forget. Onwards!!! :)"

        "report_text": "[Oct 2021: This report has slightly changed from the original, which was published in Jan 2019. Language has been improved, the author's weight was corrected from 76 kg to 80 kg, and an intro was added.]\r\n\n\n\nA SHORT NOTE (AROUND THREE YEARS AFTER)\r\n\n\n\nI have re-submitted this experience just for stylistic reasons. I read it again some days ago and I found it quite unfriendly and difficult to read, mainly because I tried to be too precise and I used too many repetitions and clarifications that simply didn't work (the text wasn't clearer at all, while the reading became quite harder!).  \r\n\n\n\nApart from that I haven't modified the content itself. My views at some points have evolved a lot but I consider interesting to leave this trip report as it was originally. \r\n\n\n\nI have been exploring psychedelics, especially the geometry of DMT Hyperspace quite intensively during the 3 years since this experience. As expected, during that time I have lived more powerful experiences than the first trip and more beautiful ones than the trip explained below.   However, the recollection of that material is a different subject, and cannot be treated here.   \n\n\n\nIn any case, this trip still preserves great interest for me, and it stands out as one beautiful inflection point out of the several ones that have modelled my DMT and psychedelics exploration :) \r\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE \r\n\n\n\nI have always been reluctant to write down and submit an experience like this, due to two reasons. Firstly, I don\u00b4t feel very comfortable expressing something which is so personal and subjective. And secondly, because in a trip like this the perception is so disorganized or, more precisely, so differently organized from the \"usual\" one that trying to write down the sensations, feelings and thoughts that take place during the experience is quite inaccurate and imprecise.  \r\n\n\n\nHowever, I have had recently two trips that had been considerably more important than the rest, and they are so stunning that I think it could be nice to write down something about them. Both trips are independent, and can be read separately. The reason for submitting them together is that they show in some way two very different facets of the psychedelic experience. The first trip is probably the most \"powerful\" experience of my life (and a quite dysphoric one) while the second one is the best (and most beautiful) experience of my life. \r\n\nSo, after this introduction let's move to the matter of this experience report: the second trip. \r\n\n\n\n---------------------\r\n\n\n\nPERSONAL BACKGROUND: \r\n\nI am an experienced psychedelic user (even doing psychedelics almost daily or very regularly in some periods). Previous to this trip I had had lots of experiences, specially quite a lot of DMT ones, including strong breakthroughs. I had also experimented with trips and substances in different contexts and settings.\r\n\n\n\nOn the other side it is important to know that my main interest in life is Geometry (also other parts of Maths), in the sense of the understanding and visualization of beautiful, complicated, stunning and new, geometrical phenomena related to intersections, hypersurfaces, higher dimensions, etc. In fact, I am a String/M-theory and Algebraic Geometry researcher. I am a String/M-theory and Algebraic Geometry researcher..  \r\n\n\n\nThis intellectual/professional passion is also my main interest about the psychedelic experience and without it you cannot understand why this concrete trip was so significative and beautiful to me. In this sense, I think my interest in DMT is quite understable, taking into account its visual and geometrical richness. For example, quoting PsychonautWiki: \"The geometry present with smokeable DMT is considered by many to be the most profoundly intricate and complex set of visual geometry found within the entirety of the psychedelic experience\". \r\n\n\n\n---------------------\r\n\nSETTING: \r\n\n\n\nI live alone in my house. On this occasion I was sitting at my desk with my laptop and several monitors showing different images, papers and videos about nice, colorful and intricate geometric visualizations (including representations of \"higher dimensional\" ones). The lights of the room were completely on (I wanted a bright, clear-colored scenario) and although it was quite hot, I was wearing a lab coat (I know is kind of freaky! ahahahahah but I like high temperature, and above all the coat gives a futuristic taste for my imagination to run wild). In the time before I had been thinking and meditating abut some geometry stuff. \r\n\n\n\nAs an aside: I don't like to \"give advices\" or something cause every brain is different. However, I think people tend to underestimate the influence of the content of their own minds in the time previous to the trip (not only the setting but the \"questions you have\"). I think that having some nice, true questions in mind can contribute to make the trip more interesting (and also can make the brain not to recreate itself in a bad feeling or thought, which otherwise it can originate a bad trip). \r\n\n\n\n At the beginning my mood was not very relaxed, but neither too nervous. \r\n\n\n\n---------------------\r\n\n DOSAGE AND PRE-TRIP: \r\n\n\n\nPrevious to the main trip, once I had already prepared everything, I did a first trip (my intention was doing several). That one was also quite interesting on its own but it turned to be just a prologue of what was going to happen :) so I am not going to detail it here. I smoked slightly more than 40 mg in my GVG quite properly during a nice time. It was considerably powerful and I broke through. \r\n\nI am unsure if I took several hits or only one. What I certainly remember is that by the time I started to feel more or less normal (I was still a bit high, but not very much) I took my other GVG with around another 45 mg of DMT. And then the main trip began... \r\n\n\n\n--------------------- \r\n\nTHE MAIN THING  \r\n\n\n\nThe main thing is that I was transported into an HYPERDIMENSIONAL 6-D world and my mind was amazed in happiness and saturated (in a good way) in geometrical blooming and celebration.\r\n\n\n\nTo arrive to that crazy state the process was quite strange and very hard to put into words but I'll try to do my best: \r\n\n\n\n At the beginning I started to feel heavy (specially my chest and shoulders) and I started to sink in my chair by sliding with my right shoulder following a circular path. At the same time the visions started to appear and a new scene was overcoming the physical \"real world\". A circle line appeared and then a yellow-orange-golden figure-scene started to emerge from the right. At the same time, I was following circular paths (which started with the circle line) inside the figure-scene. Then the figure-scene became ampler and ampler gradually and got a more complicated shape,\t although it retained some spherical symmetry. \r\n\n\n\n During the process the sense of touch played an interesting role: the real displacement occurred when I \"moved in a touch way\", imagining I was moving my shoulder/chest.  \r\n\n\n\nAs this was happening, I felt a bit uncomfortable because I felt somewhat trapped (I felt a modified gravity attracting me to some point) and also my movement capability seemed limited (I only could move in circular directions contained in the spherical-like figure/scene I was in).\r\n\n\n\n However, that feeling of uncomfortableness lasted quite short. The reason is that I soon realized that this strange movement pattern was so because I was inside a new space inside the normal space: I have been compactified* by the DMT entities. \r\n\n\n\n*(A kind of \"technical\" note here. Compactification, as some people may know, is a common term in math and physics. In string theory basically deals with the idea that the universe is not really 3D (or 3D+time) but 10D (or 11D in some version of the theory). These extra dimensions are required for the fundamental strings of energy to originate only the correct particles we \"see\" in our world (electrons, quarks, etc.) and not unphysical ones (tachyons). As the extra dimensions are not observed they are assumed to be very small instead of extended, (i.e., so small that we cannot move across them, (the typical metaphor is to imagine a wire with a circular section: we may perceive it as a line but a little ant can move along the circular, internal direction of it)). So, the extra dimensions are compact: they are curled up formed a compact manifold, that it is usually of \"Calabi-Yau\" type. So, when I say I was compactified I am referring roughly to I had become the little ant.)\r\n\n\n\nSo, let's return to the action: by that time the vision became quite intense. Together with the compactification revelation I was experiencing powerful feelings of euphoria and joy. The previous constraints on the movement disappeared and the hyperdimensional character of the scene imposed itself. By that moment I was able to move and displace freely in 6 (7 with time) spatial dimensions (or I had a delusion/perception very similar to that). \r\n\n\n\nI was absolutely amazed and exultant and just by the moment the visions reached their peak I was submerged in a complete happiness and stunningness because, as I said, I had been transported into an HYPERDIMENSIONAL 6-D world while my mind my amazed in happiness and saturated (in a good way) in geometrical blooming and celebration.\r\n\n\n\nI could perceive like 6 dimensions at the same time: there were a 3D normal scene plus a 3D scene (the yellowish kind of geometric one (spherical with also some other figures -- maybe some kind of cylinders arranged across different hyperplanes -- everywhere) and both of them were overlapped and inserted in the same sight/scene/space, like in a 6-manifold/variety, and I perceived each of the 6 dimensions as an independent direction (which is indeed the definition of spatial dimension). \r\n\n\n\nAt this point there will be some people quite sceptical, so this requires some qualification. Like this report, there are lots of people here and there saying that they have been in a higher dimensional space during similar experiences. I don't claim I have really experienced such a thing: I am convinced that it is physically impossible (at the end these are chemical alterations of the brain, and they cannot break the physical barriers of our world). My interpretation of what really happens here is that there are plenty of spatial, visual and perceptual distortions/effects caused by DMT. When these distortions are mild, they are more or less easy to break down and describe. However, when they are wild or they combine in funky ways they create visions and perceptions of strange geometries and spaces.  \r\n\n\n\n These spaces are not really impossible (e.g., they are not higher dimensional) but they are (sometimes) quite strange and offer a good parable, metaphor or approximation to impossible spaces. So, when I say I saw or perceived a 6D space what I mean is that I had a hallucination so convincing or intricate that it was easier to depict it as a metaphor of higher dimensional space rather than describing in detail a very long array or complicated effects. On the other side I am not regarding any strange visual or rare perception to be \"higher dimensional stuff or impossible space\", I try to be a bit rigorous and careful with those terms.\r\n\n\n\nNow, it is quite useless trying to explain the entire thing but I can (inaccurately) describe several components of it in order to give a glimpse.   One partial analogy (and it is just a distorted approximation, like a parable or a projection to some inferior dimension) can be the following. Imagine that the exterior scene and the exterior dimensions (the room and further things) are symbolized by a rectangular clear blue prism (3D) and the other dimensions (occupied mainly by the yellowish vision that emerged from the beginning) are symbolized by a curved yellow cylinder, like a \u00bc of a slim torus (counting the interior of it, so we have another 3D figure and a result 3+3=6D). The figures are arranged like in this figure. \n\n\n\n From now on we will symbolize our focal point with a red ball. I will refer to the ball in the following, but just recall I didn\u00b4t see a physical ball, it is just to mark my focal point. What happened is that my mind interpreted the prism and the torus to span 6 different, independent dimensions in total. For example, the ball could move to the front in the cylinder and to the background in the prism at the same time. To understand this we can use this following picture: \r\n\n\n\n Imagine that you see at time t0 the figure 0. Then you see at time t1 the figure 1 and at time 2 the figure 2. The geometrical perception is so accelerated, blooming, rich and exalted and both images are perceived so fast, with such a short period of time t2-t1 that the brain has problems to see which image is perceived before. It almost interprets that it is perceiving them at the same time. So, it interprets that both the ball of figure 1 and the ball of figure 2 are the same ball, moving at the same time both along the direction X5 in the prism and in the direction -X3 in the cylinder. Helped by the autosuggestion of being in a hyperdimensional scene/sight the mind thinks that that is possible because they are independent dimensions (directions). \r\n\n\n\nTogether with this time disorganization when you are perceiving directions which provokes a kind of superposition of images there is another important effect. There is a strong perception that the space is \"strangely\" expanding, becoming AMPLER, so things seem to go further from you (kind of hyperbolic-geometry like) but retaining somehow the original form (so things seem to expand in a new direction). \r\n\n\n\nThat is a rough metaphor of the geometry and visual aspect going on. However, the mental component was also quite strong, as expected: I had done a breakthrough as the reality - together with my role in it - had gone completely and substituted by another one. It was certainly a more progressive, not so abrupt, breakthrough than the average of my breakthroughs (maybe because my relaxed mental state before the trip?). Anyhow, at some point, when I was already compactified and I was experiencing the hyperdimensional thing, I was in another reality. I was in the hyperspace, but in this time, unlike in the other trip the most accentuated facet of hyperspace was clearly the hyperdimensionality (geometrical feeling) rather than the hyperreality (ontological/existential feeling), although both of them were present. \r\n\n\n\nAt some point the principal vision started to subside... As long as the main thing was ending, I started crying in happiness... there were also secondary visions... I do not remember the entire thing, neither all the visions and sensations I had. Which I certainly remember is that as I came down, I was extremely exultant. I felt like my neurons were saturated in joy and in geometrical richness.  I felt like my neurons were saturated in joy and in geometrical richness.  \n\n\n\nI was crying in happiness and when I closed my eyes beautiful 3D multi-colored, geometrical figures formed themselves, lots of planes and other objects turned around and intersects among them in incredibly beautiful ways, they came to the centre of the image and spheres arose in their intersections in the centre and expanded along all the image. (These images lasted quite more than usual when I am coming down).  \r\n\n\n\nAs I was coming back to reality, I thought that the DMT entities had explained to me and let me feel compactification and extra dimensions in a way that my limited brain could understand. I had perceived with all the senses (sight, touch and all the others) and in a beautiful way 6 different dimensions, in an amazingly beautiful hyperdimensional scene. \r\n\nAll the experience\u0085 it was so so so extremely BEAUTIFUL, so amazing\u0085 I didn\u00b4t know I could ever experience that amount of beauty. It was so pleasant and beautiful that after all, the first thing I did when I recover my consciousness was crying with happiness and sob \"so beautiful!\"\", \"oh my god!!\"... I even screamed a crazy strong shout \"It is so beautiful, GOD!, GOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!\" In fact I recorded some of the reflections, descriptions (also some of the sobs and screams) to capture a bit of the moment and help me to remember some things ;) \r\n\n\n\n --------------------- \r\n\nAFTERTHOUGHTS:  \r\n\n\n\nAt last, I had had the mythical-unimaginable-indescribable-best-experience-ever that changes your life I had always read about in some DMT and other psychedelics reports. I didn\u00b4t expect it to come in such a spectacular fashion (as I had done a good quantity of trips and psychedelic experiences before). This lucky event could be caused by different things (and of course, pure luck played a role): one main cause was good mood/mental state: I had achieved to get rid off some obsessions and loops/bad thoughts I was worried about some months ago (like the ones previous to the other trip I reported). \r\n\n\n\nDays after I was thinking about some interesting points. I am a person with a very pro-futuristic world attitude, in the sense that I believe in transhumanity, mind uploading and other scientific marvels, and I think that in remote future human beings will be able to live, perceive and feel extraordinary, mathematical, scientific, aesthetical experiences. In this context the experience of this report encouraged me (even more) to keep on exploring Geometry, String/M-Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Mathematics etc. and to try to participate in that future. \r\n\n\n\nOne reason is that maintaining this kind of experience as a constant state of the brain would be quite similar to some kind of paradise. Maybe it will have to be complemented with some elements or inputs that help to maintain a constant train of thoughts if necessary because, even though lots of rich connections appear in the psychedelic experience, they sometimes manifest a lack of linearity and focus (in some aspects) which would be nice to be enhanced or corrected (to be functional in some way!). Also, in a slightly more practical way, I will explore geometrically some of the visual/geometrical/perceptive effects and thoughts that appeared in the trip, and they could also be useful in the future in the context of trying to build illusions or simulations of hyperdimensional perception. However, regarding this direction, it seems complicated to accurately replicate this kind of illusions without the component of autosuggestion of the brain that had been present in this trip, it would need lots of precision. \r\n\n\n\n---------------------\r\n\nNow, after all of that I almost don\u00b4t know what to do. It is like \"You have been born, raised, thought, felt, worked, and now you have lived that\u0085 so\u0085 it is OK, you can already die\". In fact, some days later I took a plane and when it was taking off, I thought for a moment that if the plane accidentally crashes I wouldn\u00b4t be very worried, I can pass away quite realized and satisfied... ahahahaha. \r\n\n\n\nOn the other side I had let a quite long period of time (and still some time left) in order to assimilate it, enjoy and celebrate what I have lived, let it rest, integrate it, write a bit about it etc. Once I have done a (partial) analysis I almost surely will keep on doing psychedelics, but this was indeed a profound before and after."

        "report_text": "Prologue.\r\n\n\n\nIn my late twenties I was vacationing with friends in the Pacific Northwest. We were early into the first day of our trip up the Oregon coast when we stopped at a rest area where tourists could watch the monumental waves crash against the giant black cliffs. It was magical. My friend Jack, a playful daredevil, was taking in the scenery from the edge of one of these cliffs. I walked near but stopped a few feet behind him. In the distance we could see a massive wave growing towards us. I ran in an attempt to stay dry. The wave hit so hard that I could see the ocean spray at least ten feet over my head. Soaked and laughing, I turned back to see how well Jack had fared. But he was no longer on the cliff. Peering over the edge, I could see his body being tossed around by the violent ocean below.\r\n\n\n\nWe scrambled to save Jack. Someone called the police. Someone else ran up the road to try to find help. A couple people tried to swim out to him but got slammed back against the rocks by the vicious current. Helplessly, we watched as one of our best friends went underwater. He never came back up. \r\n\n\n\nBy the time the coast guard arrived, his body hadn\u0092t been seen for over ten minutes. Even if he had been conscious he couldn\u0092t have survived. \u0091Why couldn\u0092t I save him?\u0092 I asked myself over and over again. My body burned with raw emotion as agony and confusion radiated throughout my entire being. It was as if every chemical in my brain was firing at once and the circuit board was being overloaded. For a long time I believed the intensity of that moment could never be rivaled.\r\n\n\n\nPlaying with Spiritual Dynamite.\r\n\n\n\nWhen I first heard about DMT I was scared to try it. I had been through a period in my early twenties where I was a devout believer in psilocybin and LSD. I wouldn\u0092t shut up about it. I tried to convince all my friends to take psychedelics. \u0091It was the key to understanding Ultimate Reality,\u0092 I told them. But after a severely traumatic LSD trip briefly left me believing that nothing was real and I had experienced death, I decided to spend less time taking psychedelics and more time researching them. This is what eventually led me to the book DMT: the Spirit Molecule. The experiences described therein were so bizarre and foreign that I eventually worked up the courage to try this mind-altering substance.\r\n\n\n\nBefore long, I came into possession of a sizeable amount of DMT. A few friends and I sat around taking hits out of a Pepsi bottle that we rigged with aluminum foil. Inexperienced, we would eyeball what we thought to be the appropriate amount. In retrospect the amounts we were attempting to smoke were absurd. It\u0092s a miracle we didn\u0092t hurt ourselves. Instead, the opposite happened. We wasted all of it. Between not being able to vaporize the DMT properly and the leaks in our Pepsi bottle pipe, we simply couldn\u0092t take hits big enough to feel anything. I was frustrated. The most I ever felt was a horrible taste in my throat and faint closed eye visuals. I wasn\u0092t sure if I had \u0093broken through the veil\u0094 but as far as I was concerned the DMT experience consisted of only mild hallucinations and nausea.\r\n\n\n\nYears went by since my initial experimentation. I had given up on the so-called Spirit Molecule when my friend Morgan invited me to stop by his apartment one afternoon. The first thing he asked when I walked through the door was, \u0093are you ready to blast into hyperspace?\u0094\r\n\n\n\nAs he weighed out a tiny metal spoonful of white powder with scientific precision, he explained that he had tripped approximately 30 times in the previous month. He told me about his experiences of ego death, contact with trans-dimensional beings, etc. - all the typical stuff you hear about the DMT experience. I told him about the Pepsi bottle. He bluntly replied I had been doing it wrong. Morgan was experienced with DMT. More importantly, he was a smart and loving friend. I trusted him. With his help I believed I would finally get to peek through the veil.\r\n\n\n\nVaporizing DMT without getting it too hot can be difficult. To keep the DMT at the right temperature, Morgan used a buffer of cannabis that had been previously used in a vaporizer and left to soak in Everclear. Afterwards, it was dried again. It was reduced to combustible plant matter. Any cannabinoids would be gone. As long as I only lit the weed, the heat would vaporize the DMT underneath. Even if I inhaled the weed, I wouldn\u0092t cross contaminate the experience with a marijuana high. He also gave me a small dose of a powdered MAOI in an attempt to stay under the influence of DMT longer. He also gave me a small dose of a powdered MAOI in an attempt to stay under the influence of DMT longer. \n\n\n\nHe packed a glass cannabis pipe then asked what music I wanted to listen to. This was important. He warned against anything too contemporary as it had a tendency to take him out of the experience in his previous attempts. I laid back on his couch, anxious, as Vivaldi\u0092s Four Seasons Recomposed by Max Richter began to fill the room.\r\n\n\n\nMorgan held the pipe and lit it for me but I coughed on the first hit spilling it everywhere. I apologized. He reassured me it was fine. As the music continued to swell I grew increasingly nervous. I briefly tasted the burning plastic/mothball flavor of DMT and was reminded of how sick it made me feel the last time. What if I threw up during my trip? But before I got too caught up in my thoughts Morgan was back with a freshly packed bowl.\r\n\n\n\nWith the first hit I got the bad taste again. Then things got interesting. On the second hit Morgan\u0092s arms and the pipe seemed to grow longer by several feet. I glanced over at him. His skin now had a reptilian cragginess to it. His face lacked the defining features that I would recognize as Morgan\u0092s but instead he looked like the most generic person I\u0092d ever seen. Just a blank face. It was like I was seeing Morgan through the eyes of an alien who couldn\u0092t tell human beings apart. \r\n\n\n\nEven though my throat was sore from the DMT smoke, I knew I had to take another hit if I was going to cross over. I inhaled the third and final hit. My eyes reflexively closed shut. \r\n\n\n\nT+ 0:00:00\r\n\n\n\n\u0091HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!\u0092 I screamed internally. The instant my eyes closed I was no longer sitting in Morgan\u0092s apartment. From reading the Spirit Molecule I was under the impression that it was going to be like a roller coaster. Wait in line. Get strapped in. Slowly see the cart move up the tracks. Clink. Clink. Clink. Until finally the coaster drops down that first big hill and the ride begins. But no. This was absolutely instantaneous. Absolutely. Instantaneous. It was as if the bottom fell out of the room and I was suddenly plunged into a free fall.  It was as if the bottom fell out of the room and I was suddenly plunged into a free fall. At least generally when something unexpected happens in life, let\u0092s say if you\u0092re getting mugged for instance, the mugger might have the decency to scream, \u0093GIVE ME YOUR FUCKING WALLET!\u0094 before they blow your brains out. My entry into the DMT Dimension was less cordial.\r\n\n\n\nMy entire body clenched. I was startled, confused and felt a familiar feeling of all the chemicals in my brain firing at once. My circuit board was getting fried. It felt like I got blasted in the chest with a spiritual shotgun. My eyes burst open before I had even a second to decipher what I was seeing.\r\n\n\n\nT+ 0:00:00.5\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Please hold my hand.\u0094 I begged like a child clinging to its mother. Morgan obliged. \r\n\n\u0093This is all happening inside your brain. You\u0092ll be fine.\u0094 That helped. I closed my eyes again.\r\n\n\n\nT+ 0:00:03\r\n\n\n\nNothing could have prepared me for what I was witnessing. I had broken through the veil so instantaneously that my mind was reeling to catch up. I wasn\u0092t just in a different room but a different dimension: albeit a familiar one that was somehow realer than real. What I had previously called \u0093reality\u0094 seemed muted by comparison.\r\n\n\n\nIn this realm I had no body. I was simply a silent watcher of the unbelievable. There was a luminous \u0093ball\u0094 of energy directly before me. I use quotation marks on the word \u0093ball\u0094 because although it was round-ish in shape it was somehow also amorphous, constantly changing. It radiated incomprehensible, totally impossible patterns and colors beyond the visible spectrum of light - new colors I had never seen before.\r\n\n\n\nFor a split second the amorphous sphere seemed like visual gibberish until the next moment when I could make out that it was comprised of several \u0093beings.\u0094 These Beings were reaching out towards me then retracting back into the sphere. Sometimes they would stick their faces inches from where my face would be if I still had one. They were constantly moving and impossibly fast. An arm here. A face there. Over and over. Without words I got the impression that they wanted me to follow them. It was as though they were saying, \u0093Come with us! We have the most important thing to show you!\u0094\r\n\n\n\nAnd I have to stress, this all happened the instant I shut my eyes. \u0093Overwhelming\u0094 doesn\u0092t begin to describe the sensation. \r\n\n\n\nThe Beings were ecstatic that I could join them. It was a celebration. They were wearing childish masks and laughing and making silly, contorted, dumb faces. The Being that stood out to me the most was wearing a cat-like mask. It would lean in extremely close to my line of sight and pucker its lips revealing buck teeth and shaking its head. It was the opposite of profound. It was utterly stupid. But I was in awe of it. It was as if the Cat Masked Being was telling me to \u0091stop taking everything so seriously. Your life is just an elaborate, ridiculous game. Enjoy it! There\u0092s nothing to worry about. When you die you will come back to this again.\u0092 One expects the profound to be revealed by someone like an elderly monk who has been meditating solemnly in a cave for decades. But these Beings acted like spastic maniacs. They were literally bouncing off the walls.\r\n\n\n\nThe room itself seemed to stretch infinitely down a long black and white tiled hallway. And the Beings reflected this infinite tunnel as if they we made of liquid metal. It appeared like the hallway was constantly in motion while my feet (if I had any) and the amorphous sphere remained in place. \r\n\n\n\nThe Beings continued celebrating and motioning to me for what seemed like a very long time. It turns out it was only about two minutes. I\u0092ve read that DMT can feel like an eternity but for me the time dilation was more akin to cannabis. The first intense couple of minutes felt way too long, but in the same way that a good song can seem really long when high on weed. \r\n\n\n\nAfter a while of watching this spectacle I calmed myself and decided to follow them.\r\n\n\n\nT+ 0:02:30\r\n\n\n\nAs soon as I made the decision to follow, I was transported to the place they were trying to show me. The Beings were no longer visible but I could still sense their presence - as if they were watching over me. This new place was a series of slowly shifting reds and blues covered in complex geometry. It was less intense than the previous experience but somehow more awe-inspiring and serene. For a good visual reference it was kind of like the DMT sequence in the movie Enter the Void. Although I would say the film\u0092s sequence is like a crayon drawing by comparison. \r\n\n\n\nThis new place was what all the commotion was about. It was incredibly familiar. I felt like I had been there many, many times before. It felt like possibly the inside of my mother\u0092s womb. I believed I was being told that this was the place you go when you die and wait to be born again. Could this have been the Supersoul that everyone and everything is supposedly a part of? Or Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita? Or what Schopenhauer called the Insatiable Will to Life? It didn\u0092t feel like I was learning something new but instead remembering something forgotten.\r\n\n\n\nIt was so beautiful that tears started streaming down my face.\r\n\n\n\nI had been a staunch atheist when I sat down on Morgan\u0092s couch. But when my trip was over I was converted to at least an agnostic. Before, I felt certain I had a solid grasp of what an experience could be. I knew that I would probably never go into space in my lifetime. But at least I had a notion of what stars look like in the night sky. I had never climbed a mountain. But, I knew what a summit looked like in photographs. Even though I couldn\u0092t replicate the exact feeling these things my imagination can fill the gaps. But there was no experience on Earth or in space or of this dimension that could have prepared me for the impossibility I witnessed on DMT. The limits of experience had been transcended.\r\n\n\n\nT+ 0:08:30 \r\n\n\n\nEventually, it faded. I was left staring at the darkness of my closed eyelids. When I opened my eyes, Morgan advised me to look out at the clouds. They looked a weirder than usual. Kinda cool. But it was nothing compared to what I had just experienced. I had returned to the \u0093real\u0094 world. And it seemed duller than when I left it.\r\n\n\n\nBack to Earth.\r\n\n\n\nWhen Morgan asked me about my trip I tried to explain it to him. But I fell short. What had just happened to me? As soon as it was over, it started to fade. \r\n\n\n\nInstead, I started rambling about Jack. It had been a year since his death. The initial shock of the DMT taking hold felt so similar to how I felt on that day in Oregon that it must have triggered the memory. I started crying. Not because I was sad. But because I was overwhelmed - by the DMT Dimension, by the past trauma, by the weight of existence. I hadn\u0092t cried over Jack since the moment he died. Even at his funeral I found it difficult to show emotion. For a while I had pushed it into a dark corner of my mind. But the floodgates were now open.\r\n\n\n\nSome believe the DMT Dimension is a genuine place. Others think it\u0092s just chemicals generated in the brain. I can\u0092t say for certain. But I do know that all experience - love, fear, anguish, etc. - is also generated by chemicals in the brain. I\u0092ve personally witnessed the emotional weight of a legitimate life-or-death situation. I\u0092ve also personally witnessed the mysterious and incomprehensible realm generated by smoking DMT. I would be hard pressed to differentiate which felt more real."

        "report_text": "First DMT Trip\r\n\n\n\nI have never done any psychedelic drugs before this experience, except mushrooms, which I wouldnt really consider at all. At least what I had. However, I smoke weed on a daily basis.\r\n\n\n\nI was once offered what I was told was some of the most purest acid there was, by a person that blew glass for a living. Not just bowls but beautiful glass sculptures. I refused, due to that fact I wasn't very comfortable with the new people I was around, but my two friends I was there with did it. \r\n\n\n\nAnyhow, what makes this interesting is I just did DMT for the first time tonight, roughly 3 to 3 1/2 hours ago, at the time of this sentence. My room mate had done it before and had talked about how he would like to get some if he could again. Well tonight we talked with a good friend who brought up that he knew where some was and had tried it. I listen to his experience which I will briefly relate. He said there was a lot of colors and like a colidescope type effect. He referenced a few visuals as seeing geometric shapes, and how a person's face he was around was patterned as such. He went into other details that I wont relate mainly due to the fact that I want to relate my experience, however he stressed its intensity.\r\n\n\n\nYou know it! Me and my room mate picked up a '1 dose bag' and went home and split it. It was in a very small plastic bag that people commonly get with shirts that have buttons in them. You may know them better as nickel sized baggies people sometimes but a blunt of weed or so in. It was faint yellow in color, a powder, which stuck the the bag in a semi-unusual way. Not like coke, this still was formed in almost bubbles. I didnt decide to do it until I got home, i.e. at the place of purchase I said I wouldnt take it. However, as we got back home I realized I was presented with something special and that I should take this gift.\r\n\n\n\nDue to some events that would make this annoying report more annoying that I wont say; we did not have any of our weed pieces. We concocked a makeshift gravity from a 1 1/2 gallon Hi-C bottle. We split the DMT what at the time I thought was 40/60. Me doing 40% of the bag while my roommate did the other 60%. However my roommate later recalled that he would put it closer to 30/70. We also based it with a tiny amount of heady quality weed.\r\n\n\n\nI decided to go first, partially so that my roommate could watch over me. Keep in mind I had no idea what I was getting myself into besides other peoples stories. AND LET ME STRESS OTHER PEOPLES STORIES DONT DO JUSTICE AND COULD NEVER RELATE TO YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH DMT. The only thing consistant with all the accounts is the colors.\r\n\n\n\nHe fills the gravity I hit it, then sit back into the couch and wait. I held in the smoke for what my roommate said was 15 seconds, I could have held longer but I did on purpose to curb my dose. This I should never have done, besides 10 seconds of tingle and a weird feeling I got nothing. SHIT. NADA. I was upset, mainly with myself for not holding in longer. Oh well fuck. My roommate goes, and holds it in much longer. He sits back is very quiet, said a few statements such as 'oh yea' , and 'floatinnnggg'. For the most part he was very quiet for 4 minutes or so. He had his eyes closed for about 90% of this 'trip'. He then confirms its legit but said he had a smaller dose than he has ever gotten and said he just saw 'smoke', and the room faded out a bit. This was hardly a good trip.\r\n\n\n\nI was frustrated so we went back. The guy had just '1 dose' left and my roommate offered to let me have it. I quickly said yes, and vowed to do the whole dose and would hold it in as long as possible. We re-scored, and this time we decided to put it all in a 1-hitter weed pipe, which was our only other piece at the time. My roommate packs it up I hit it and hold it in for approximately 50 seconds (this is what my roommate said). The rest of this will be my actual account of description of my FIRST DMT experience.\r\n\n\n\nBefore I released the smoke, my living room had turned to a shade of orange. Similar to looking through Orange sunglasses lenses, however the orange was more like the color of an orange crayon, not a light tint as if I really were looking through Orange glasses. This last approximately 5-10 seconds then the room turned into a shade of neon green. This color was much more intense and abundant than the weaker, meager orange that paled in comparison. I then began looking at the tv which we had intentionally put on some music which was coupled by a still picture. I then released the smoke and laid down longways on a love seat-type couch that I was sitting on. I closed my eyes and for about 90% of the remaining time my eyes were closed.\r\n\n\n\nI didnt go to another world, I did not have a deeply spiritual experience, and I actually knew where I was I didnt go to another world, I did not have a deeply spiritual experience, and I actually knew where I was and began rubbing my face and holding my palms over each eye. This position and reaction I did nearly the whole time of my 'trip'. Constantly rubbing my face, hair, and constantly covering my eyes with my palms as if I were crying. I was utterly silent for most of the 'trip'. When I closed my eyes I saw an explosion of colors but the most prominent color was green, now which was much less neon than it had been before. About 1 minute in I told my roommate 'to turn the fucking tv off' and he did.\r\n\n\n\nI saw many colors and were 3Dish and some patterns. I also felt something. Something. Something that was so deep and intense it is very hard to describe. This was not an emotion, not fear, not love, not acceptance, not excitement or anticipation. None of that bullshit that I have heard other people say about their DMT trips. To be honest I felt no emotion at all, but this feeling was strong and overwhelming and ever present. This coupled with the colors and an extreme intensity would be the best way to describe my experience. I also felt/remember fragments of my experience that are so fleeting I cannot say if they really happened. I felt a type of presence but not of a human or god or anything like that. I experienced an overwhelming neutral feelings coupled with a presence of something I couldnt adequately explain if I was given the rest of my life to elaborate.\r\n\n\n\nThere was a brief dialogue between me and my roommate during the trip and some of me talking after I was coming down some. I will also recall this to you. A few minutes in I asked my roommate while my my eyes were closed how long had it been. He said 2 minutes. I then recessed into my 'trip' for another few minutes and again asked my roommate how long had past. He said 5 minutes. This was just a familiar voice coming from my left throughout this experience that I knew was my roommate. These were the only words spoken besides the TV comment until roughly 6 minutes when I began rubbing and covering my eyes more intensely to the point where my roommate asked if I was alright. I responsed yes, I was alright, seemingly more right than I ever had been, but in the same instance not.\r\n\n\n\nAs I began to come down I opened my eyes and began stammering out my experience. I could only get out a few broken sentences that involved the word unexplainable a few times. I purposely dropped to the floor and put my face, which was in my hands, into the carpet as if I were a muslim praying. I then had an overwhelming emotion of not sadness but something different. More like a broken understanding of life. I spoke the words ' I think I am going to cry'. My roommate responded go ahead man its ok. I then sat up and put my back against the love seat and deeply exhaled. I mainly sat semi-silent, half in shock at what had just happened to me. The next 2 minutes I spoke often but made little sense. Mostly broken statements and exclamations that would not and could not be put into words. I sat dumbfounded and said aloud 'I wish I had that on camera. You are the only one scott (my roommate). The only one that knows, the only one that will ever know'. This concluded my 'trip'.\r\n\n\n\nLastly I want to explain something that I would say is the most important part of this whole VERY LONG encounter. The most important thing is this experience was very dreamlike in the sense that once it is over the experience is so fleeting, so distant it becomes harder and harder by the second to remember exact elements of the experience. This angered me but also allured me. This beautiful thing. This beautiful experience. This gift, would become harder to remember and harder to cherish. I read 2 testimonials before I wrote my own and one thing another person said about there experience with DMT rang very very true with me. The fact that the more you try to articulate and recall the experience the more it diminishes the trueness and unexplainableness of the experience. It truly is something that cannot be successfully articulated. It just cant.\r\n\n\n\n'The experience cannot be shared, and as I read over what I have typed, I understand that I have only served to diminish the experience, and turn it into an absurdly inadequate written version ' -quote from him [experience report 16314] that explains it all. I thank you for reading but not as much as I thank myself for writing this."

        "report_text": "To give you a quick history of my past hallucinogen use I am experienced.  The first hallucinogen I ever used was mushrooms.  I have a long standing history of LSD use.  It has been over 10 years since the last time I dropped acid, but in the prime I would usually call 10 plus hits a good trip.  The most LSD that I have consumed in one setting was 32 hits of liquid.  I have tripped on mescaline 2 times.  Both trips were via San Pedro cactus tea.  I have tripped on both Morning glory seeds and baby woodrose seeds multiple times.  I have tripped on Salvia.  I have used 2CB on time.  I am sure there is something out there that I have yet to try but for the most part I have tripped many times on many things.  \r\n\n\n\nThe first time I had ever heard of DMT was some 15 years ago.  There was an article in High Times about it.  After I read the article I had made up my mind I had to try it.  I have been in pursuit of the spirit molecule ever since. I searched and searched for DMT.  I learned what I could about it on various websites and forums.  Not too long ago I realized that if I was to ever find DMT I would probably have to extract it myself.  So I found a website that sold Mimosa hostilis root bark.  I ordered 100 grams of the dried root bark along with all the other needed chemicals.  I was so excited once everything arrived in the mail.  I followed a procedure I found on the net and I finally had DMT.  \r\n\n\n\nOver the past 15 years I had grown to build a fearful respect for the spirit molecule.    It took multiple tries over the period of 3 days for me to finally, \u0093break through.\u0094  It took a few days even after having extracted the DMT for me to muster up the courage to even try the stuff.  I wanted to start slowly and increase the dose as I grew more familiar and comfortable with DMT.  \r\n\n\n\nMy very first DMT experience I smoked just above a threshold dose.  I took my finger and got the slightest bit of DMT crystals to stick and then I brushed it off onto a small piece of foil.  I wouldn\u0092t even say that there was any more than 5-10mg on the foil.  I was standing in my walk- in- closet with the lights on. I didn\u0092t know how I was going to react to the spirit molecule so I took a really small hit.   I felt a little head change.  I didn\u0092t know how I was going to react to the spirit molecule so I took a really small hit.   I felt a little head change.  Everything in my vision seemed to vibrate a bit.  I didn't know if this was just due to what I had read online or if this was the actual effects of the drug.  I took another hit.  This time I saw the white crystals melt into a yellow puddle.  I saw the white vaporous smoke rise up into the straw which I used to inhale.  I could taste the smoke too.   It was nasty and it was hard to keep from coughing it up.  It tasted just like burning plastic smells.   I held it in as long as I could.  As I exhaled I felt kind of like I was falling forward.   I kept feeling like I was falling forward a little bit.  My vision was focused on some books on the bookshelf in front of me.  A serpent like kaleidoscopic pattern of purple and green popped out from between the books.  I felt very comfortable.  There was nothing unnerving about this threshold dose.  I didn't break through but the next 20 minutes or so were spent in a pleasant mild psychedelic state which reminded me of being on a small dose of mescaline or mushrooms.\r\n\n\n\nThe very next day I woke up with a renewed want and desire to fully experience DMT.  I weighed out 30mg.  I only had foil so I put the 30mg on the foil, I and went to lie down on my bed.  I lit the foil from the bottom and melted the DMT just like a tweaker smoking meth.  A yellow puddle formed and I tried to hit it but there was not much smoke.  I exhaled what little bit I did get to vaporize and as I did I felt a head change.  It was subtle.  I noticed a slight strobe like effect.  I held the lighter up and hit it again.  This time I got a good hit.  I kind of burned a bit.  I almost coughed but I held it down.  As I exhaled I felt as though I was falling through a visual 'dimension\u0094 then SLAM!  The falling stopped.  My vision was clouded with a blur almost as if I was in a dream, and I was looking through a cheese cloth or something.  Everything seemed to be moving slower than usual.  In the distance I noticed a color changing kaleidoscope of neon yellow, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, and blue in the distance spinning.   electric neon display that was spinning.    I took another hit, and I felt myself fall through yet another visual dimension.   The color ever changing kaleidoscopic electric neon display that was spinning     in the distance moments ago was now right in my face.  The colors were very bright and very blinding.  They were swirling about in almost a dizzying fashion.   I was still very aware of myself as there wasn\u0092t much of a head trip to accompany the amazing visuals I was seeing.  The only thing I remember thinking about at this time was how comfortable and safe I felt.  I knew I hadn\u0092t broken through yet so I wanted to take another hit from the foil, but I realized I was too high to take another hit.  The colors were in my face, and I felt like I was in a dream.  Even though I wanted to smoke more I couldn\u0092t even see the foil enough to focus on it or to hit it.  I put down the foil and began to let go as much as I could and enjoy the electric light show that was happening. \r\n\n\n\nAs the colors swirled in front of my face I noticed there was an image in the center of my vision that was not swirling around like everything else.  I focused in on what it was and I realized it was Ganesh.  I saw the elephant ears blowing in the wind.  I saw arms moving up and down in a wave like motion.  Everything around Ganesh was still swirling and spinning but Ganesh.  I was definitely experiencing a hallucinogen which was far more powerful than anything I have ever known before.  I was still very aware of my self though.  I knew that I hadn't broken through.  \r\n\n\n\nI started to come back and noticed that I had only smoked about half the 30mg I had put on the foil.  I thought it was funny that most people say that DMT is a 5 minute trip.  The peak maybe, but I was still tripping for about 20 minutes after my peak.  The experience was great.   I couldn\u0092t wait to try it again.  I knew if I was going to break through I had to find a better way to smoke the stuff.  Smoking through foil was just too harsh.  I couldn\u0092t get enough of it fast enough to break through with the way I was smoking it.  \r\n\n\n\nAfter some research I found a smoking technique that involved smoking the freebase in a bong after wrapping the DMT in foil.  I sat down with my bong.  I had already measured out 40mg.  I wanted a full blown experience but I didn't want to black out.  I have read that doses in the higher range of 50-60mg you end up blacking out during the trip.  I laid back in my bed.  My wife was there with me to take the bong out of my hands when I needed her to.  I started to hit the foil in the bong stem.  I saw the bong filling with a white vaporous smoke.  I didn't feel any burn or taste the nasty taste as I was hitting it.  I knew it was working though because I saw the smoke in the bong.  Then I noticed the vibrations beginning to start.  I had done enough DMT in the past few days to recognize this tell tale sign of a threshold dose of DMT.  The vibrations had started.  It was like an electrical current of energizing perfection and bliss was buzzing through my body.  With the pulsing current came an even greater vibration in my vision.\r\n\n\n\nAs the vibrations hit me I noticed that they were much more intense than I had yet known them to be.  This caused some excitement in me because I knew I must be on the verge of finally breaking through.  I had no more breath left.  I pulled my mouth from the bong and exhaled.  As soon as I was able to I pulled the stem and cleared the bong.  It was still an amazingly smooth hit compared to what I had been used to from the past two days of experimentation.  I put the flame right back on the foil and began to hit it again.  I was hitting it hard.  I knew I was close to breaking through.  The visuals already had gotten more intense than I had yet experienced from DMT.  The visuals reminded me of tripping on an 8th of some good cubes. Then all of the sudden I felt a fast fall.  I was looking down at my bong trying to get another hit before it was too late.  I finished my last hit and handed the bong off to my wife.  Everything from this point is kind of a blur, but I have spent an entire day reviewing the trip and this is how I remember it happening.\r\n\n\n\nAs I fell through I looked up to my ceiling and my vision saturated by bright red light.  There was a feeling of warmth and great comfort.  I felt as though everything was perfect.  I could only feel warmth and love.  Then in the blink of an eye I was traveling through a tunnel.  As I was traveling through the tunnel I heard voices.  The voices were telling me, 'Welcome we are here with you.' There were many voices and they kept repeating this over and over.  The tone of the voices was very comforting.  As I traveled through the tunnel everything happened so fast, yet it seemed to last a timeless eternity.  Then just as quickly as this had all started I was thrown from the tunnel into the universe.  I had just experienced total astral projection.  I was now in outer space.  I was in the heavens, and the voices continued to tell me that I was welcome and that they were all with me.  Time had stopped and I was one with everything.  I was a bodiless entity.  As I began to come back down to earth and regain my identity I was overwhelmed.  I felt the most profound joy I had ever felt in my life. I had just been shown something that I never could have imagined.  The first thing out of my mouth as I regained my senses was, 'Wow what the fuck was that!?' I spent the next 30 minutes or so just overwhelmed by the joy from what I had just seen.  I felt so alive and so real.  DMT is not something to be feared.  DMT truly is as Dr. Rick Strassman titles it, 'The Spirit Molecule.'"

        "report_text": "A bit about my trippy past: I've smoked the ganja for about 5 years. Mushrooms about 8 times, Acid about 15 times, Mescaline twice, LSA twice, MDMA once, Ketamine once, and a light DMT dose once.\r\n\n\n\nSo I took a couple puffs of a deemster joint about a year ago... It was crazy, but I still hadn't gone all the way. I hadn't 'broken through' as they say in DMT-lingo. Even though I was still somewhat connected to this reality it took a good 10 minutes after the experience ended to make sure that I was still the same person. It scared me a lot. It was a month before I decided I would be willing to do it again, but none had been around.\r\n\n\n\nUntil last night. (about a year later)\r\n\n\n\nA friend got some generic smoking herb (damiana?) infused with DMT extracted from mimosa, so a few of us went to his house to try it out. Me and 3 friends sit down and roll a deemster joint. We pass it around, and each take a couple of puffs. I notice that my friends are taking little girly puffs. They have no breathing\\smoking technique! We all got to the first stages of a DMT trip. Significant body high, minor visuals, and that sense of imminent death. The people I was with took their little mouthfuls of smoke and exhaled quickly. That's not how I do things. =D Next time the joint came around I breathed deeply a couple of times to oxygenate my lungs, then I exhaled as fully as I could before beginning to suck on the joint. I took a looong slooow hit, and held it in for as long as I could.\r\n\n\n\nI got pretty freaking high, and found myself face to face with this faceted greenish wall or sheet. It undulated and oscillated, superimposed with triangles and gears. This sheet in front of me seemed thin, though. I had a feeling that immediately behind the sheet (which visually was about 6 inches away from me) was a vast space. After a few minutes I came back down, still not having 'broken through.' I intended to.\r\n\n\n\nWe took a break, visited some friends who lived near by, and came back later that night to smoke some more. This time we loaded a bowl into a glass pipe. My friends passed the pipe around with me last. Each one of them took a couple of tiny puffs, and exhaled white smoke immediately. All of them felt effects, but no more than before.\r\n\n\n\nI decided to demonstrate the zen of smoking. They were talking amongst themselves as I accepted the pipe. I breathed slowly and deeply a few times, exhaled fully, and torched the whole bowl as I veerrry slowly inhaled. I kept the bowl cherried for 30 seconds, inhaling slowly the entire time, and leaned back in my chair, holding my breath. I felt it coming on fast and I wasn't even close to exhaling! With a roaring sound in my ears, I realized that I was about to see what this stuff was all about.\r\n\n\n\nI exhaled, leaned back, and my chair broke. It was my friends house, and at first he was pissed and said something to me about it, but I was on the way out of this world, and barely heard him. With no chair, I stumbled forward, then sat down on the cement, and rolled to a laying position. It wasn't a choice - this stuff knocked me to my feet. I heard one of my friends say, 'Ohh look at him.' noticing that I was being blasted to hyperspace. I must have had a crazy look on my face. I was not on earth anymore, my mouth was wide open.\r\n\n\n\nUnfortunately it wasn't exactly pleasant...\r\n\n\n\nI spent probably the next 5 minutes in some form of personal hell. I remembered God from my Catholic school childhood, and realized that with the ignorance of that age held innocence, and I knew that I had drifted far away from that innocence. I was being punished, and I knew I deserved it. I was in a personal Hell and felt I would be there for eternity. I did not think I was coming back - how could I ever be the same? I was in a personal Hell and felt I would be there for eternity. I did not think I was coming back - how could I ever be the same? I was swimming through geometric chaos intertwined with poignant and emotional imagery from my past. GOD! God did this to me! God finally had enough of my shit and decided to fuck me up. I did NOT expect this. GOD!! I DID NOT EXPECT THIS.\r\n\n\n\nGOD!! God it's my fault!! This carnival of terror seemed like a fitting and deserved ending for my wasted selfish life. I realized that I would never be the same again and would not be capable of functioning in society. I would end up in a mental institution, living in this perpetual hell while my family occasionally came for tearful visits. Holy fuck. I managed to say, 'Don't do DMT' to my friends, and never have I been more serious.\r\n\n\n\nWe exist? We exist? We can never experience death... Death is no experience, so you can come close, but you can't ever experience nonexperience. I came as close as you could, maybe I even went through it, but how could I know? I am alive - I am not-death. I was sitting on the edge of death. It was like I perpetually hadn't existed the moment before, and was constantly sitting on that moment. I was in a constant state of just-coming-into-existence. WE EXIST? WHAT THE FUCK?\r\n\n\n\nI apparently yelled the words 'GOD,' 'FUCK,' and 'DMT' several times.\r\n\n\n\nI could hear my friends (Friends? They 'exist?' I 'exist?' 'Exist?' WTF!?!?) having a conversation.\r\n\nOne said, 'Well we don't use most of our brain...'\r\n\nAnother, 'Maybe that's what happened to him? He just opened it up and got flooded.'\r\n\n\n\nThey were talking about me. I was rolling on the ground with my face in my elbow... But I was returning, sort of. I got to my feet after a few seconds said, 'Be right back...' I walked inside for the change of scenery, and laid face down on the floor. :-p\r\n\n\n\nI called my sister who I had invited to come by that night but she couldn't make it. I said, 'I love you. Don't do this stuff.' she said, 'I love you too. Okay.' And we said bye and hung up...\r\n\n\n\nAnother 5 minutes and I walked back outside and sat with my friends... We talked a bit about what I had just experienced which was exceedingly difficult due to the indescribable nature of the experience compounded with the fact that I was still tripping. Balzz. I kept saying, 'Dude it was just... Fuck... I don't fucking know.'\r\n\nAnd my friend would say, 'You mean you don't remember?'\r\n\n'No I remember.. It's just.. I don't know.'\r\n\n'Tell us something - a word.'\r\n\n'We.... Exist. When the fuck did that happen?'\r\n\n'Well how was it?'\r\n\n'Flush that shit down the toilet.'\r\n\n\n\nI was still tripping. I still felt as if I would never be the same - I felt like I had just been born into the moment, like I literally had never existed before. It was scary as fuck, and I thought 'I'll never be the same person again, regardless of whether or not I stop tripping!*'\r\n\n\n\n*That part is true.\r\n\n\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I was pretty much back to normal, laughing at normal stuff, holding normal conversations conversations. I realized that my DMT experience was terrifying but amazing, and retrospectively a gratifying experience. I was too hasty when told them not to do it, to throw it away... (Obviously they didn't.) In fact I realized that I'd be willing to do it again the next night. (tonight :-p)\r\n\n\n\nI've come to the realization that there is life after death from many different angles in the past: religion, drugs, philosophy, logical rationalization of the nature of consciousness... NEVER has it been shoved in my face so hard that reality, existence, consciousness, *I* am eternal, that I am alive for eternity, as it was under the influence of DMT. There is no such thing as death. There is no such thing as death. There is no such thing as death. I KNOW this.\r\n\n\n\nDMT is crazy. I still don't know what the fuck happened.\r\n\n\n\nI think DMT is a good thing. I took a massive amount and I'm in a strange place mentally anyway. Most people's experiences aren't as unpleasant as mine was at the time. Either way, I'm glad I did it and will probably do it again tonight. Maybe it won't be so rough the second time around. It was life changing and I am a different person. I wasn't ready."

        "report_text": "30 March, 2007\r\n\n\n\nI was 50 years old at the time of this experience. I have a significant history of psychedelic drug use; somewhere well north of a couple hundred trips over 30 years, including numerous high dose and a few very-high-dose LSD, mushroom and mescaline trips, as well as a couple go-rounds with peyote itself. I have been \u0093truly humbled\u0094 by LSD, including one requisite soul-destroying experience--which I consciously set myself up for--that I felt reverberations from for about ten years. \r\n\n\n\nOf course, most of that was in my early- to mid-twenties, though fairly steady into my thirties. I\u0092d since tapered off to a low- to moderate-dose trip once every year-or-three. I\u0092m significantly more sensitive to and aware of Set and Setting, as well as dosage. (E.g., no more \u0093Fear and Loathing\u0094 at work, out on the town, or Las Vegas.) Moreover, though it\u0092s still a bit of a crapshoot--one never has complete control over Set, Setting, or dosage--I still consider the psychedelic experience to be immensely worthwhile. On some level, it is now even more profound--and definitely more meaningful--than during the heavy tripping I did in my twenties. Perspective is everything, and I think there\u0092s something to be said for \u0093maturity\u0094 as well. \r\n\n\n\nAlthough I\u0092d heard about DMT long ago, it wasn\u0092t much talked about in my peer circle, and definitely not readily available. Since other psychedelics were readily available, and because LSD quickly became my psychedelic of choice, DMT was never on my radar \u0093back in the day.\u0094 However, over the 10 or so years leading up to this, I\u0092d had an increasing curiosity about DMT, and had read and listened to a lot of information about the experience. (Thanks, Terence, et al.) I decided that if the time was ever right, I would go out of my way to try this elusive and intriguing substance. Well, I finally decided the time was right--one of my \u0093winter projects\u0094 of 2007 was an extraction of Mimosa hostilis, which turned out to be a success.\r\n\n\n\nThe literature gives fairly detailed information on what the DMT experience entails and \u0093proper\u0094 dosage. However, as an experienced acidhead, I\u0092ve learned that it\u0092s generally best to start out on the low side with any new substance. I like to get a feel for the subtler aspects of the experience to begin with, and to gauge any personal reaction that might\u0092ve been missed in \u0093the literature.\u0094 Metaphorically, I prefer the initial match I strike to start a nice campfire, or at most, a huge bonfire suitable for a pagan ritual. I\u0092ve found that it\u0092s best to avoid igniting a firestorm that consumes the entire forest, including me.

Alone; in my bedroom; comfortably warm; soft, indirect lighting; Aeoliah\u0092s \u0093Angel Love\u0094 playing as ambient background music, otherwise it\u0092s virtually silent. After several minutes of deep-breath meditation, I settle down from extreme nervousness to slight apprehension, accepting whatever is in store.\r\n\n\n\n10:10 p.m. One hit, moderate, held a long time. Intense Blast!-off; suborbital.\r\n\n\n\n11:20 p.m. One hit, large, held a very long time. Lips, teeth, and gums cold/numb where smoke passed. Room temperature warmer than normally set, yet I feel chilled. More intense Blast!-off; still suborbital. \r\n\n\n\nBut that Blast!-off? How to describe? Physical: insectile reptilian electric ZZzzzzztttch! Mental: psycho Peter Max Yellow Submarine Blue Meanie EYOWww! But that Blast!-off? How to describe?

From \u0093here, now\u0094 to \u0093THERE-WOW!\u0094 in 30-60 seconds; perhaps similar to arriving about an hour into a high dose LSD trip in 60 seconds. Yet, not quite. Somehow, more disconcerting. (Though perhaps my saying that is just due to its unfamiliarity. A high dose LSD experience is certainly nothing to dismiss lightly.)\r\n\n\n\n12:15 a.m. One large hit, held a very long time. I intend to take a second hit but am swept away...\r\n\n\n\n... what is real...? what is reality...? what is universe...? what is GOD...? I am nothing, toying with the very fabric of reality, tempting GOD to annihilate all that exists... WHAT HAVE I DONE!?!?!?  yet, now what do I do...?\r\n\n\n\nI don\u0092t know if the preceding means anything substantial to the reader. It is what I wrote shortly after returning. The only metaphor is--possibly--\u0093GOD\u0094 (which is why I used all caps). There was no memory of a past, no prospect of a future, and no \u0093time\u0094 to make \u0093me\u0094 \u0093real.\u0094 There was no memory of a past, no prospect of a future, and no \u0093time\u0094 to make \u0093me\u0094 \u0093real.\u0094 Yet I had sufficient presence of mind to be aware of a \u0093reality\u0094 (in this case, the entire physical and spiritual universe, other possible dimensions, etc., i.e., everything that exists) that was threatened. Truly terrifying. (I mean, heck, I was only expecting \u0093elves\u0094 or somesuch.) Utterly exhilarating? Yet I\u0092m back, so was it really such a big deal?   \r\n\n\n\n...YES...   \r\n\n\n\nWill I try it again?. . . . .?. . . . . . . .?. . . . . . . . . .?\r\n\n\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Why not . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\n\n\n1:00 a.m. The two hits I try are harsh, nasty, and I can\u0092t keep them down. Too soon to break through again... and simply, too soon. Think I\u0092ve had enough for tonight.\r\n\n\n\n+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +\r\n\n\n\nI wish I could better articulate the \u0093hallucinations\u0094 that accompanied the experience. Physical almost on par with the psychological (though since of course it was all in my head, \u0093physical\u0094 seems a bit of a misnomer).  Both were intense. \u0093Digital Alien.\u0094 A sense of \u0093behind the scenes.\u0094 Not the familiar \u0093observation\u0094 of the visual, audio, and tactile hallucinations of psychedelics that I\u0092m familiar with, but I think somehow being the colors, sounds, and physical sensations. Uniquely DMT, yet somehow not totally unfamiliar. But truly, truly, bizarre...\r\n\n\n\nAnd yet, I somehow think that perhaps the \u0093true\u0094 DMT experience lies beyond \u0093annihilation of all that exists,\u0094 rending the \u0093fabric of reality,\u0094 possibly into another \u0093dimension.\u0094\r\n\n\n\nI must contemplate this for a while...\r\n\n. \r\n\n.\r\n\nEpilogue, 2013:\r\n\nI wrote the above shortly afterwards (later edited to make the discussion less time-specific). My first intention was to leave it at that and submit it as such, leaving a bit of \u0093mystery.\u0094 But that\u0092s really only half of the story. The rest--the human side to all of this--was the aftermath.\r\n\n\n\nEver since that first DMT experience, I\u0092d been meaning to try it again, in order to \u0093flesh-out the story.\u0094 But it unexpectedly pulled the rug out from under me for quite a while. Ever since that first DMT experience, I\u0092d been meaning to try it again, in order to \u0093flesh-out the story.\u0094 But it unexpectedly pulled the rug out from under me for quite a while. It\u0092s one thing to be \u0093thrilled and entertained\u0094 by going to the cinema and being temporarily swept into the fantasy of watching The Matrix. It\u0092s quite another to go through day after day, for weeks, with the subtle but distinct and unavoidable feeling that I might actually be in a version of The Matrix--that this truly is all an illusion, and the veil is about to slip and I\u0092ll see the man-chine behind the curtain pulling the levers, flipping the switches, and turning the dials. For the first week or so after, I found I had to consciously repress the urge to blurt out this \u0093revelation\u0094 to passersby while in public. (Cue Twilight Zone theme...) \r\n\n\n\nPerhaps that would\u0092ve been novel in my twenties (though I have every reason to believe the experience and/or reaction to it would\u0092ve been significantly different at that point in my life); just way too the-other-side-of-sane now. And since I had every intention of substantially increasing the dosage (if possible) to get past the ambiguity of the first experience, I felt quite certain I would\u0092ve been propelled further along that vector. So it wasn\u0092t a headspace I could be cavalier about recreating.\r\n\n\n\nIn the intervening time waiting for the Right Time, I\u0092d had a few encounters with Salvia divinorum, another weird, fast-acting reality-warper--though, at least from my experience, not even remotely in the same league as DMT--which was legal and available over-the-counter at head/smoke shops at the time I did it. \r\n\n\n\nTo stir the pot further, I also survived an absolutely hellishly devastating experience on psychedelic mushrooms, by inadvertently combining them with hydrogen peroxide(!?) (A whole other story all its own. Needless to say, I don\u0092t recommend the combo. At least it was \u0093food-grade\u0094 H2O2...) \r\n\n\n\nAnyway, I reached the point where I had to seriously ask myself what the fuck I\u0092m continuing to do this for. \r\n\n\n\nI then went through my second 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat.  During that time I had a few epiphanies. One being: It is time to discontinue my ongoing if sporadic and increasingly weird dance with psychedelics. The underpinnings have simply become too fragile, my current reality a bit too unstable. This \u0093psychonaut\u0094 is, at least approaching, perilously close to becoming a psycho-nut. \r\n\n\n\nAlthough I\u0092ve been through many psychedelic experiences that I\u0092m oh-so-glad I\u0092ll never have to endure again, the vast majority I will always treasure, and I have absolutely no regrets about what I\u0092ve done. I feel privileged to have lived in a time and place where I had the opportunity to explore the limits of my own consciousness way beyond my wildest expectations. My use of psychedelics has had a major influence on my worldview and the trajectory of my life, and though there are definitely less-than-desirable \u0093side effects\u0094 to parse out, I believe the vast majority of their influence has been unquestionably positive. \r\n\n\n\nSo it\u0092s time to move on--stick to meditation, the increasingly-occasional toke, and good sex. Not a terribly unappealing fallback, if I really stop to think about it. Life is good. I don\u0092t rule out tripping again sometime in the distant future, but I\u0092m no longer seeking it out, and it would have to be a very special occasion."

        "report_text": "DMT, MDMA, 2C-B, 2C-T-2, 2C-I, 2C-E, Cannabis, Alcohol & Tobacco - multi-day experience\r\n\n\n\nPreface:\r\n\nI am a young man who tries to stay healthy and live a positive life. Recently I had been in a bit of a slump from which I needed to get out of. I have prior experience with most \u0093commonly\u0094 known drugs, with the exception of LSD (not that I\u0092m opposed to it), and have some experience with a few lesser known RCs. This is the story of a revelatory week which reminded me of the beauty and connectedness of everything as one. Other characters in the story are G who I had known for a few years, who had no prior psych experience, taken MDMA twice, alcohol, and cannabis. B and I have been close friends for 3 years and we\u0092ve chewed shrooms a few times together, rolled a couple times, and in the two weeks prior to this we had tried ketamine for the first time and on another occasion had another beautiful afternoon where he took 2C-B and I took 2C-T-2.\r\n\n\n\nFriday:\r\n\nIt was the last day of classes and I had had glowing experiences on such days. There was a fair number of psychedelics I had in possession, but the one which I wanted to give highest priority was DMT. I had 200mg total of a fluffy, almost waxy powder. One of my best friends, call him B, was also curious but felt it wasn\u0092t the right day for him. The day went as usual, relaxing, smoking some bud, until another friend, call her G, who I\u0092d known for a few years through B, but only ever shared brief encounters with, came over; which was happening more usual than lately, and I had been getting to know her better. A coincidence was noticed amongst the group how she seemed to fill the \u0093place\u0094 of another friend of ours who had recently gone abroad, and naturally we gently missed him. G was also wanting to blow off steam with classes being over, and suggested MDMA, which I also happened to have a moderate amount of. B and G are both down to roll, so I decide it\u0092s probably time to talk to Dimitri. I first pack each B and G a capsule of 140mg and a cap of 80mg, I pack myself one cap of 170mg in case I want to roll after I come down (who wouldn\u0092t want to roll with a bunch of friends?). I dose out 48mg of the DMT into a vape I made using a glass tube and a bunch of pipe screens, and adapted it to fit our bong.\r\n\n\n\nDMT, (Part I: Breakthrough):\r\n\nB and I escape to the empty room, left by the aforementioned friend, which still cosily had a bed, a couple chairs and table; he\u0092s going to spot. I take my last breaths, calm myself then I gave it all I could and cleared the bong. I lay back in my chair and held my breath as long as I could, and as soon as I exhaled things started getting really shroomy, but before I could even think that I was launched off, and then there was an overwhelming rush of just everything, all at once. Before I knew it I was in what I\u0092ll call The Sea of Knowledge/Flow of Conscience which was immensely beautiful on its own, but then I was met by what seemed like a gnome; but I never really saw a body or appendages because he was wearing a top hat that was the most incredible thing, and he took me around that realm giving me this sneaky grin every time I would realize something new. I asked him to tell me something I couldn\u0092t possibly know, (in a sense to test the local/non-local source of the effects). He revealed something to me, which exploded into bursts of light and extremely complex geometries, once the fanfare was over I found myself in an endless yet somehow compact \u0093zebra\u0094 patterned box world, I tried to grasp at what he told me but I had forgotten it. \r\n\n\n\nThe whole experience moved very quickly and I soon left the box and just found myself staring at a flower that kept morphing into other objects in the foreground of yet an even more highly complex red-orange pattern. I slowly start to come back to reality, I begin to feel my body again, but the walls are moving and drooping all over the place with flashing circles of light around objects in the room, and tracers/afterimages galore. Eventually I feel grounded enough and look over at B and say \u0093whoa, that was awesome\u0094, he says \u009310 minutes on the dot\u0094, looking down at the timer on his phone, \u0093wow you really could do it on a lunch break\u0094.\r\n\n\n\nMDMA, (Part One: Manifestations):\r\n\nG and B had popped the first caps, and feeling as great as I did from being shown into such a rare realm, I threw mine back too. I couldn\u0092t feel any more at peace right now and I still have to look forward to some more delightful chemical intoxication. G had been chilling in B\u0092s room while we were away and it was starting to hit her nicely, she asks how the DMT was, and I explain it. Starting to feel the M come up creeping on, we go chill and hit a few bowls in the other room, all of us really starting to feel it. We fold down a futon and bundle up in a cozy heap all jumbled together. There was an extremely erotic energy in the room, but not really in a sexual way (I was pretty sure neither B nor I would not be able get hard cause of the M anyways), everyone just enjoyed the presence of the others and we felt into this bliss for a while. \r\n\n\n\nThe idea came up that we (B and I) had manifested G into our lives to replace the void that our other friend had left. This spiralled off onto more sexy conversation about how we are all just products of the energy we give off/surround ourselves with. G realizes several hours have passed and that they still have the supplemental cap. B and I feel fine, but G figured it was worth taking since we had it. She swallows hers and coaxes B to take his by pretending to pop it herself too, B complies and takes his. \r\n\n\n\nI remember reading in PiHKAL about how 2C-B was given near the end of MDMA sessions and brought back both effects with more power, so I decided to rail 5mg 2C-B mixed with 5mg MDMA. (Yes it burned for a little while, but it didn\u0092t bother me too much, even nose pain can feel fantastic when rolling). We decide to go get some snacks and smokes at the corner store so we bundled up (winter) and headed out. I was coming back up, and I was starting to feel the cartoony feel of the 2C-B coming on. As we walk it\u0092s like I haven\u0092t felt closer to people, especially B and G, and could never do harm to anyone. Nearing the store in the distance I see the light of the sign, and it takes the image of the gnome from the DMT, but just his little sneaky grin, telling me that he leaves that hat at home. We get the supplies and head back. Futon cozy-up is back as were all seeming to peak again. We enjoy in our delights and have a fantastic rest of the evening. At this point I realize I\u0092m stretching it, but as a night cap I rail 5mg of 2C-T-2 on the second comedown as it has been reported to be used in the same way as mentioned about 2C-B. This one\u0092s a real burn, 5mg is more material than the 5mg of 2C-B (makes sense) but it starts to come on right away. Beautiful CEVs fill my sight when I close my eyes and wonderful patchwork geometry was appearing around the walls, I was in control of energies around and was very much able to control even the color and behaviour of the patterning. I kept enjoying these tricks I had, and felt so blissful and connected to everything. Eventually I had to crash, but still got to enjoy the beautiful hypnagogic imagery as I floated away to bed.\r\n\n\n\nSaturday:\r\n\nI awoke at a fairly early time, quite unusual especially since I had no reason to, and had been up all night. I wouldn\u0092t say that I felt any worse than I would have, if I had just gotten that little sleep on its own. I usually keep things like 5-HTP on hand for these times, but I didn\u0092t have any then. I cooked myself a bunch of eggs and toast and took it with a bit of vitamin B6, (I believe 2C-T-2 has suspect MAOI activity but I knew some tyramine would get my levels back to normal). I head over to B\u0092s house which tends to be the usual hangout. We hit a few bowls and talk about how great last night was, and we still feel really good. G comes over and we all genuinely agreed that we missed each other. G says that the MDMA had made her think in a completely different and way more positive/beneficial way. She wanted to do it again tonight, I made sure she knew the effects would certainly be diminished 2 days in a row, but she kept interested. In a way we all did have that missing link in the circle from the previous night, or maybe just the hedonistic mood we\u0092d been in, we decided to roll again. I weigh out the M I have left and it doesn\u0092t look like it\u0092ll be enough for all of us, we\u0092ll need more. G knows a connect and before we know we\u0092re off to get 500mg. I had 180mg left of the previous stuff that I will take, I scale B and G off each 150mg and 60mg sup (this time the timing will be better), but I decide before dropping I want to go back to the DMT realm.\r\n\n\n\nDMT, (Part 2: Time Tourist):\r\n\nIn the same setting I throw back the rip as best as I can. There seems to be more residue left than last time (I cleaned it between uses) and the taste is slightly more acrid. After the exhale, wonderful things began happening again. Color bursts from all over the room, and I get a somewhat tense feeling, then a buzzing deep in me that kept growing. I thought that this would build to liftoff and breakthrough, but the rocket just fizzled a little and had to abort. The tension lifted and then I felt like I was being shown the history of civilization and all the art/visuals associated with all the cultures of the world, and the same morphing flower from the first time, which was everything, appeared again, but blocking my entrance into hyperspace this time. The trip continued on more, reinforcing the one-ness of conscience life as an entity. I was still far gone but started to talk to B: \u0093It\u0092s still going on a fair bit, but I didn\u0092t breakthrough this time\u0094, \u0093You\u0092re around six and a half minutes\u0094, after interacting I was effectively grounded again, but still got to take in the walls melt and shift. They were covered in glowing green script written in a language that doesn\u0092t exist (or never been known?) and I was trying to comprehend what they were saying until I returned to baseline about 10 min later.\r\n\n\n\nMDMA, (Part 2: Both sides): \r\n\nNone of us had rolled more than 3 times prior to this, so naturally its use tied to clubs/raves/festivals gives it its bad name. We had all agreed from the night before that the far more powerful use of it was for psychotherapy, but tonight there was a bit of a rager happening with some DJs I know spinning all night so that was on the agenda if we were feeling it. \r\n\n\n\nWe relax and hit a couple bowls but it\u0092s starting to come on. G exclaims: \u0093whoa, It just hit me really hard\u0094, and then I just felt a huge energy rush as well. I said \u0093We\u0092ll both focus, tell me the letter of the alphabet I\u0092m thinking of\u0094 we focused on it and she said fairly confidently \u0093R\u0094, my jaw dropped to the floor, (that was the letter). We exist on this really high energy and everyone is fantastic. \r\n\n\n\nWe popped the second pills (there was some left and G gave me the last 85mg) but they said this stuff was a bit speedier than mine but still pretty good. We had a few beers, and headed for one of my buddys\u0092 sets. The music is kicking great, I\u0092m full of energy to dance, and my inhibitions are a bit lower so I\u0092m more confident around everyone. I can only complain about my jaw clenching, but I\u0092m aware of it and can keep it at bay. I run into a friend I haven\u0092t seen in years who also happened to drop tonight, it didn\u0092t even matter what we talked about, it seemed to get me more caught up and connected to him now. B, G, and I jam there for a while, but really we all just wanted to go back to cuddle-land on the futon. We finished the drinks there and headed home. We were flipping through Netflix and saw the movie \u0093The Secret\u0094, G had heard of and read bits of the book, I had heard of the book and movie, but probably passed it off as ridiculous or something. It was funny to come across it, because that was the exact way we had been feeling things worked. Basically the principle boils down to attracting positivity by being positive, and actual faith/belief that what you want is yours, because it is. We all made lists of what we wanted to see happen, modest things, or just for the hell of it, mundane as: be a good day today, to whiting out bank statements and putting in false huge numbers hoping that those numbers will somehow actualize.\r\n\n\n\nSunday:     \r\n\nI wake up Sunday, it\u0092s a beautiful day (B willed it on his list) and I have a text from a girl I had been seeing casually. It wasn\u0092t going anywhere and I hadn\u0092t spoke to her in a while, but the text basically said she understood we were coming from different places, and we\u0092d both find someone better. Coincidentally I had randomly added \u0093new girl interests\u0094 at the bottom of my list before bed, weird. There is a banquet tonight so everyone is dressing up and we\u0092ll have about 40 people there, B, G, and I will all be there together. The night is great while everyone catches up, B is trying to bring people in on our revelation, but I really do think one has to actually feel a powerful experience to benefit from such notions. We end the night with a nice buzz going from drinking and blazing, talking about all these sexy ideas, I\u0092ve tripped with B a fair bit before, and his trips focus a lot around death, so discussing that transition was a fair part of the analysis.\r\n\n\n\nMonday:\r\n\nMonday is fairly mundane, we are all still at really high energies and feel fantastic, as just cogs in the fantastic cosmic machine.\r\n\n\n\nTuesday:\r\n\nI have some studying to do, and from experience 2C-I has a fairly clean stimulation, only small body load, so I weigh out 4mg and take it with a choline supplement, and a few racetams. Studying is going well as I feel concentrated, thinking is easy, and time is slower. I get a message from B telling me he\u0092s ready for the DMT, so I bring it over, G is there and embraces me saying how good it is to see me. We talk a bit, but almost immediately B says he is feeling different, almost like he is rolling, and his energy is really good. I remember the excerpt in PiHKAL on 2C-I of someone experiencing a contact high at a session when they took none, so I tell him that I took 4mg as a nootropic. At first he is sceptical, but I show him the excerpt, and he says he feels undeniably high, it\u0092s quite remarkable. We talk a bit about my experience, and then 47mg weighed out and ready. \r\n\n\n\nB and I retreat to his room. He takes the hit, but it seems to have left a bit more residue and he has a bit of trouble clearing it. He falls back in his bed as he exhales, and I see him start to grin. A few minutes in he looks to me, extending his hand, telling me, \u0093You have courage\u0094, I nod thanking him saying nothing, he continues for a little while before asking where G is and to get her, I summon G and she comes to observe. She doesn\u0092t know what to make of B at the moment, asking \u0093is he still on it?\u0094, I nod, and try to indicate to be quiet/not to be distracting. B is baseline about 12 minutes after the hit. He says he didn\u0092t breakthrough, but also still had a phenomenal experience. He said that he was telling me I had courage because we were going to die, and I was going with him, but then it didn\u0092t happen. He concludes he has a big ego and that an ego-death type experience would have to be \u0093the gnarliest thing ever, I would really have to believe I was dying\u0094, to which I respond: \u0093that\u0092s the point, and the harder you hold, the more visceral it will be\u0094. B has always doubted the visual effects of psychs, saying they certainly mess with his head, but he doesn\u0092t see anything that a sober person couldn\u0092t witness, always rationalizing the effects down to light bouncing or shadows that other people are too busy to see. I\u0092ve tried to convey that that\u0092s what part of the visuals are, and the nature of the light/shadows is being played on by the chemical and your perception of it. After the DMT he is convinced, but sees DMT at another level than other psychs; to each their own. B has been curious about LSD for said accompanying visuals, but none of us have tried it. \r\n\n\n\nI say 2C-E is purported to be quite visual (which I happen to have), and as one the magical half-dozen may be a powerful tool. None of us have prior experience with it but I\u0092ve done research and warn them that it\u0092s a real psych, even more so than 2C-B (which B thoroughly enjoyed). We all do some more research and decide that we\u0092ll imbibe. I say 22mg, B says 18mg, G is a bit on the fence but says to pack her 12mg. As I go to prepare it, colors and textures of buildings are saturated like no other and there is a beautiful gradient in the sky, and it\u0092s not even a nice day. I remember the 2C-I, and I realize it\u0092s is doing more than I thought. I decide to play it safe, and pack myself a smaller 12mg dose instead.\r\n\n\n\n2C-E, (Day 5: Rebirth):\r\n\nB and I take our doses, but G decides to wait a bit and see how we react. B thinks it would be a good idea to watch the movie Samsara, which are just visuals from all over the world depicting humanity from its highs to lows. He believes it is on YouTube so we search, but we end up starting watching some other movie (about actual Samsara in eastern religions). 20 min in we realise this isn\u0092t the movie we were looking for and turn it off. We flip the lights on and right away I see patterns all over the walls, all the cracks on the floor were shifting and melting. B says he\u0092s starting to feel it too. G takes hers, and we put on some music. \r\n\n\n\nWe\u0092re in cozy futon mode relaxing, hitting a few bowls, when B starts to get uneasy. He flips back and forth between thinking whether he is depressed or not. We try to talk him through it by finding the source of the depression. B would think about it, say that there wasn\u0092t anything, so he couldn\u0092t be depressed. He would then cycle back to before and the same idea started again. B began the get extremely anxious and was verging on a panic attack, I offered him 3mg of xanax which G agreed would definitely help. But it proved very difficult to get B to take it, because he was hung up on his ability to do anything he wanted, and he was trapped thinking about what to do. He also believed that we were in some way tricking or testing him as projections from his own mind. With enough coping, while he briefly snapped out of it we convinced him to take it. As soon as he took it he said he instantly felt eased, but then fell back into the trip. I tell G that (barring him throwing up) it\u0092ll take effect in 15-20 min. I wait it out and the xanax starts to bring him down a bit. He is no longer as anxious but he says he doesn\u0092t want to feel the drug anymore. I remind him that it\u0092s a journey, and now that you\u0092re on it you have to ride it out. Things seem more under control, so I slip out to the store for a minute before they close. When I return B is still dealing with having to ride out the effects, but G and I assure we\u0092ll be here the whole time for him. We are all quite inebriated and cuddle up with few clothes on. Neither B nor I are gay/bi, but neither us cared and it didn\u0092t matter, it was just what was nice to be in everyone\u0092s presence. Hands felt all around and nobody cared for whose limbs were whose, we were all just one. We all felt like we reborn over and over again by each other and it was incredible. B was glowing, He said there were visuals, and energy everywhere and he could manipulate it at will with his hands or thought.\r\n\n\n\nWednesday:\r\n\nWe didn\u0092t get much sleep because we were too excited about a sense of enlightenment we all felt about how we all are part of the same conscious flow capable of anything. We spent the rest of the day reconstructing the experience as we bathed in the 2C-E\u0092s afterglow. B realized the depression he was confused about was caused by that sense of loneliness of only being one, but after he had gotten through it in his trip he embraced the oneness and the depression disappeared completely.\r\n\n\n\nThursday:\r\n\nThe next day G left town for a few days and B and I were still in awe of our discovery. In light of the telepathy from the other night when G got the letter correct, we tried it with a number between 1-10. He was to think and I would guess. After some concentration I said 3 confidently, to which B nodded it was correct. Our other buddy S who had been around a bit over the past days, but had not partook in anything was with us, so we upped the stakes, S and I would guess B\u0092s number 1-20. After some concentration we wrote our answers down. S and I both said 14, while B had chosen 16. We text the question to G and we all focus on 16 until she responded. She guessed 17. We upped the stakes again. S and B left the room and picked a number 1-25 together, came back and concentrated. I said 6, and the two of them flew off the walls, because it was correct. B starts wondering what it could work with. He tells me that he is envisioning a color behind his closed eyes, and if I could see it. I concentrate and begin to see green, I announce it and B nods again with a huge smile across his face. He texts his ex and asks her to think of a color and a time she spent with him, then text the color. We await the response, and when it comes before we look, I ask S if he wants to know my guess, I whisper in his ear purple and he coughs on his water saying that what he thought. B\u0092s ex responds saying he\u0092s crazy, maybe another time. B said he was thinking fuchsia. I can\u0092t say that I was ever in control of the power, but I wasn\u0092t just making mere guesses, and experienced it.\r\n\n\n\nExtensions:\r\n\nThis was a magical week that I would describe on whole as a ++++ experience, It rekindled and reminded me of the mystical experience I had the first time I tried mescaline ~4 years prior (my first and only other ++++ experience). I don\u0092t think I would have benefitted as much had B not gotten there, as It was incredible to witness, and It made me feel extremely blessed by all experiences that I\u0092ve had."

        "report_text": "I had tried smoking DMT, I believe 3 times before this experience, all within about 6 months time. Each experience, I noticed, had a similar theme, similar visions, and similar sounds. The sound was a kind of music. The instrument, I guess I\u0092d have to say, made a sound like an organ grinder at a gypsy carnival. My family, on both sides, are Romanian, so my childhood was filled with these sounds, but this seemed almost genetic, as if the tune was being played by my \u0091heart strings\u0092, as it were. The music was of the mind but seemed so real and so loud that it affected the way my blood flowed right to each and every cell of the body. The humor of it all couldn\u0092t be denied. I remember always laughing at the notion of an organ grinder.....on a DMT trip? Come on now. \r\n\n\n\nPrior to the music, there was that crackling sound that many speak of. I associated that with the sound of taking off. That initial blast like my whole being is on the tip of a missile which had just been launched. This too, was the same each and every trip. Once racing through space at an undeterminable speed, pulling G\u0092s, going too fast to even think about when this is going to end, I begin to enjoy the trip. The beauty of DMT is the sheer speed of the experience far outweighs whatever fear or apprehension I might have going into it. It\u0092s just too much to take in. Any sense of being a \u0091person\u0092 is just flattened at a high dose, the experience becoming just that, an experience in the \u0091absence of someone\u0092 to experience it. \r\n\n\n\nRight near the peak of being catapulted a mandala wall shows up, an intricate brilliant, crystalline, multicolored gorgeous mandala, not unlike a Tibetan Buddhist painting depicting \u0091what THIS is\u0092. It became clear to me in this instant that whoever came up with those initial paintings had been to the bardo and back via an NDE, or merely had toked on some DMT at some point in their life. This mandala too showed up each time I smoked DMT, that wall so many speak of piercing before going into that land of elves.\r\n\n\n\nPiercing through this wall I\u0092m immediately aware that I\u0092m virtually parachuting downward, no longer stuck on the tip of a missile. Everything is so quiet and peaceful after moving at top speed. There\u0092s no awareness of having a body, just the experience now of floating, approaching land, knowing that something new is about to show up. It\u0092s during this time that I always become aware that I\u0092m featured having a body, that I\u0092ve smoked DMT, that I can focus on the event, the dream, or focus on the body. Am I lying down, sitting, am I in a room, where might I be? Two things going on at once, much like I feel during a lucid dream, aware of the body sleeping while dreaming simultaneously. I notice that my body smells like DMT, something between baby shit and death, but slightly pungent and organic. I notice that my body smells like DMT, something between baby shit and death, but slightly pungent and organic. This day I realize that once, during an NDE, I had awakened from being unconscious smelling like this, exactly like this and it dawns on me that I must have excreted large amounts of DMT during the NDE to have smelled so pungent. The recognition is noted but as quickly disregarded. Stuff is still happening.\r\n\n\n\nI notice my wife comes into the room and begins to play Tabla, an East Indian drum. The sound takes over. It becomes what\u0092s happening, nothing else is noticed but the music and a new smell of incense. The organ grinder had long left the premises. He was just the ride here, not the after party. Now, I\u0092ve never seen these elves others talk about, those machine like entities who come to teach you things. But this moment I understood to some extent what they meant. Instantly my body is inhabited by \u0091one of those entities\u0092. That\u0092s the only way I could describe that \u0091other\u0092 was here and it was in me. It heard the music and had come to play. That was clear. But how to play along? It had no instrument available to it, so it used my tongue and began to imitate the sounds of the drum by opening and closing my mouth, tapping the tongue in different places in the mouth, finding that the soft palate made some great deep beats. And within seconds was producing sounds that in no way, I could have done. I was being completely used. I was the instrument and this entity was doing its best to produce nice sounds and was succeeding in unimaginable ways. I was the instrument and this entity was doing its best to produce nice sounds and was succeeding in unimaginable ways. If only we had had sense enough to record this. It was too much. I would have laughed like hell but I was being occupied by the serious playfulness of this entity. This went on for a good 8-10 minutes, so my wife tells me. I had kept my eyes closed for the entire event. Sense of time, well, who cared? \r\n\n\n\nComing down, the entity didn\u0092t leave, it just wasn\u0092t there any longer. I don\u0092t remember any transition. Transitions on DMT are vague at best. Looking back I can only really remember bits and pieces. There\u0092s just too much going on way too fast. Anyway, having been inhabited by such a playful friendly yet serious creature wasn\u0092t creepy at all. I felt privileged having met such a bizarre yet fun being. From carnival organ grinder to who knows what? All in fun and play....."

        "report_text": "Background:\r\n\nI have BPD and PTSD from childhood. These days I'm completely functional but very cynical about all things spiritual and whatever, though I have had some awe-inspiring experiences on LSD.\r\n\nPrevious recreational drug experience is LSD, MDMA, 4-FA, K, mescaline, 2C-B, the occasional study stim and maybe some more I don't remember.\r\n\n\n\nSetting is in a friend's room while he does the same dosing as me.\r\n\n\n\nT+0h 150mg moclobemide, 8mg ondansetron\r\n\nT+0h15m DMT citrate made from 70mg freebase, oral\r\n\n\n\nThe nausea level was fairly low except for a few minutes after drinking the DMT.\r\n\n\n\nT+1h 70mg DMT again, 4mg ondansetron\r\n\nIt turns out I overestimated my stomach's ability to break down the MAOI pill. 70mg DMT wasted.\r\n\n\n\nT+1h30m +\r\n\nDefinite feeling at this point, everything feels stranger.\r\n\n\n\nT+1h50m ++\r\n\nIt's time to go in. I shut my eyes and start digging through the layers of my mind, similarly to meditating. I can hear a lot of my voices, judging and trying to categorize what I'm experiencing. I can feel that they are preventing me from getting deeper so I begin shutting them down. I suppose this is my ego?\r\n\n\n\nT+2h +++\r\n\nI begin to see a swirl of colours. But it's not a painting, the scale is humongous. It's like an entire universe of colours. They're not that clear, possibly due to my individual sensitivity but I can tell I'm 'deep' inside something, whether it's my own mind or something else. The scale is just ridiculous and my mind starts to try and... encapsulate (?) the enormity of it all. \r\n\n\n\nT+2h15 +++\r\n\nThe exact time in minutes is completely fuzzy and retrospective right now but it's just for reference. Right now what I'm fairly sure is referred to as the ego keeps trying to push away how I feel about all of this by putting labels on it - 'this is awesome' or 'this is huge'. My ego seemed to realize that by being there and putting labels on it, it was stopping me actually feeling the awesomeness or hugeness. My ego seemed to realize that by being there and putting labels on it, it was stopping me actually feeling the awesomeness or hugeness. So it turned itself off, like a computer would. At this point there really was no going back because I wasn't in control. I had tried to stop myself existing in this space because myself was getting in the way of something else.\r\n\n\n\nT+2h30 ++++\r\n\nI was battling with my ego for a while. It was kind of like a siege in space where these ships kept trying to pull me out of the experience and I had to stay on top of them to shut off their power. It was hard work but not distressing. Finally I had succeeded, there were no voices, no nothing to distract me from what was going on. \r\n\n\n\nAnd suddenly from out of the sea of colours there was a blast of pure love that shot through me. I knew exactly what it was, as if I had known my whole life but chose to ignore it. It was creation itself. I had a huge grin on my face. I was truly properly happy for the first time in years. And I don't mean euphoric, like being drunk or even love-empathy of MDMA. I was HAPPY. Like a normal person gets happy.\r\n\n\n\nIt seemed that I had found what I was always looking for and it was actually there all along but I either forgot or it didn't make sense to me given my past so I chose to pretend it didn't exist. And then I saw myself when I was about 8 years old. When I was a kid I used to be fascinated by all the different stories of religion, even though I'm not sure I believed any of it though I did believe in a God somewhere, doing something. But when I was 8 there was a moment I decided that there was no way God could exist, that these stories were rubbish people told themselves to make them feel better. The entire concept of spirituality was just not compatible with me anymore.\r\n\n\n\nYet here I was, finding it again. I didn't lose it, it just got buried under some rubble.\r\n\n\n\nI saw flashes of people, some of them really annoy me or I hate, including my parents, and realized that I love them. And it didn't feel discordant because I wasn't creating love to put on other people, which is how I think a lot of people internally conceptualize love, but I was *drawing* love from an infinite supply somewhere else and feeling it within myself and not trying to push it on the images of people I saw.\r\n\n\n\nT+3h ++++\r\n\nAfter a while in the love colours nest the trip went slightly darker but no more less significant. I went 'in' deeper and the colours morphed into a giant shadow figure (like from Shadow of the Colossus). Every time the figure moved its fingers my entire perception of the space would morph with it. I realized that this was the Architect (aka God). I decided not to push my luck and get to know him any better, thanked him for his gift of infinite love and moved upwards (i.e. to some level not as deep). After all, to know the true face of God is to know madness...\r\n\n\n\nT+3h15 ++++\r\n\nI was back in the sea of colours. But this time I could feel my body melting into the bed. There was just a tiny bit of my ego still alive, fighting back and preventing me from completely losing myself and becoming one with the sea. In hindsight this is somewhat frustrating but now I know that 70mg is not enough and I should probably start meditating and getting better and keeping my ego quiet. I saw some statues and various other ancient imagery but this didn't feel relevant. They felt like a distraction. I had found the truth and one day, I will be back to exist in it again.\r\n\n\n\nT+3h30 +++\r\n\nComing back up out of my mind was a rough journey. I saw fire and stone and thought 'is this hell?'. But I realized that the only reason I was seeing this kind of negative imagery, whether it actually exists or not, is that the drug was wearing off and not helping me to suppress my ego anymore. So I waited patiently, in hell, moderating my fear until I was back to reality.\r\n\n\n\nT+4h +/- back to baseline but mentally drained and exhausted. Putting words together was difficult because my brain was just so tired.\r\n\n\n\nI realized afterwards how meditation and psychedelics both help people in the same way. Even brain scans show similar activity. Although I may have come close to touching God and will always have that memory, the real long-term benefit isn't because of the drug per se but because the drug gave me a big boost in trying to shut my ego up. And that's what I do in meditation, though it's usually less dramatic and takes longer. I guess this is elementary to anyone experienced in these things.\r\n\n\n\nAt various points I opened my eyes and I'm impressed by how seamless the transition was back to reality. While getting in and getting out is hard work, once I was in it was simple to move in and out at will. DMT also gives me my favourite OEVs - other psychedelics seem to strain my eyes, possibly because my eyes try to adjust for the blurriness (I am slightly short-sighted) whereas DMT visuals are completely sharp and natural.\r\n\n\n\nFor next time I think camping, a preplanned ritual (or playlist at least - we had a random youtube video on repeat which did work well to be honest), and a higher dose (100mg) and/or a half redose are called for. But I've finally found peace. Let's hope it lasts."

        "report_text": "My first experience with DMT changed my view of life and death in a way that has affected me since.  I had never heard of DMT before my friend bought some and offered it to me and others after trying it and enjoying his experience.  We had taken acid earlier in the night but by that time it had mostly worn off.  I had also had a few drinks but I was not inebriated.\r\n\n\n\nI offered to go first.  My friend told me to take 3 large hits, holding in it briefly after each hit, and I did. I first noticed the plastic taste of the chemical and by the second hit my take on reality was changing.  My friend had to light the third hit for me because I had no control of my arms, and when I exhaled the third hit I felt like the world exploded.  I was sitting outdoors upright on a picnic table.  The first light of the day was coming and above me were green summer trees. I was gazing up at the trees and a geometric pattern of green and orange took over my vision, constantly shifting and changing in an outward glitching pattern.  The world felt pixelated.  I was aware of a buzzing noise all around me, like cicadas, and it was all I could hear.  \r\n\n\n\nThe geometric pattern lasted a few seconds before my entire vision became a melting rainbow pattern, starting above me and quickly coming down my vision leaving black above it like a screen wipe in a video. I felt the colors wash down and take the sense of my body sitting on the picnic table with it, and I felt like my body melted into the ground with the colors.  I lost all thought of my physical body.  I was told afterward that I slid off the picnic table and was lying face down in the dirt for the rest of my experience moaning softly, but I do not recall that.  I was transported to a wide void of space.  I was aware that it was a large domed room and I felt like I was in another dimension somewhere in space.  I could feel the vastness of the room and it felt bigger than anywhere I could imagine. The walls were made of a geometric pattern, diamond like, but with more than 4 dimensions.  I could also see a pattern of points of light evenly spaced within the diamond pattern and the pattern was shifting in a precise mathematical order in segments.  Everything still felt pixelated and like it was made of the very basic particles of existence.  The room was black except for the points of light. \r\n\n\n\nI was aware that I was alone in this room and felt as though I was lying on the flat bottom and breathing very slowly.  I felt like I was in this space for a very long time and began to think about my physical body.  When I concentrated on it, I was aware that my friends were around me comforting me.  I realized, without a doubt, that I was in the void where physical death occurs and the energy of the mind moves on.  I was not scared at all, but knew with all of my being that when I exhaled my next breath my physical existence would end and my energy would move on to the next phase of being.  I felt very at peace with this realization and had no fear of what came next.  Somehow I knew that my real self, the true energy of my being, would connect with the rest of the energy in the universe and that it belonged there.  I had a sense that I would be reborn, not immediately but eventually, and not necessarily as a human but just in another form.  This process, of me exhaling and dying, took a very long time in my mind.  I started to wonder why my friends were not getting me help or calling an ambulance because it felt like I had exhaled my last breath a long time ago and they should be worried.  I felt outside myself - I was aware of my body below me somewhere but I didn't care about it. I felt very at peace and like everything was ok, and like I was truly experiencing death - not just having a strange trip on a drug, but really truly seeing what death was like. I did believe that my physical body was dead.  Eventually I started to drift back to my body and then was in it.  I felt surprised that I was still alive. Eventually I started to drift back to my body and then was in it.  I felt surprised that I was still alive.  I opened my eyes and asked why I was lying on the ground.  I felt very disoriented afterward and like my view of the world had changed. My friends told  me I had been unconscious for about 7-10 minutes, but it felt like I had been gone for days.\r\n\n\n\n4 of my friends smoked DMT after me and none of them had similar experiences.  They all saw strange patterns, strange sounds, etc. but none of them went to another plane as I did.  Afterward I started to research the drug and saw that other people had reported similar experiences to mine.  I truly believe that I experienced what it is like to die and had a life changing experience.  I can't say it's made me less afraid to die because I love living, but feeling like I know what comes next is comforting.  It was supremely peaceful and I realized that every living thing is connected by energy.  The energy of our bodies moves on from our physical being to become part of the energy of the universe and move on to the next thing that it is needed for.  I believe that I was able to experience this because I had no idea what was coming.  Having never heard about DMT, other than my friend telling me it was a hallucinogen that would cause a short trip, I had no filter on my brain or fear and I was free to open myself up fully to the experience.  \r\n\n\n\nThe second time I smoked DMT I did not go to a different plane. I was too scared to take 3 hits again and only took 2.  I saw geometric patterns of green and orange again and was aware the whole time of the buzzing noise in my head and of a plastic taste in my throat.  I was scared at first and tensed up, wanting to make it stop.  I realized that mentally I wasn't ready to go back to where I went last time.  I reminded myself to relax, that there was no stopping the effects, and was able to enjoy the rest of the experience, but it was mostly seeing changing patterns and colors.  \r\n\n\n\nI am not sure if I will ever do it again because it was such an intense and reality-changing experience but I am happy that I had it."

        "report_text": "Im sure that whatever I try to write down will be a fairly cheap description of what a DMT breakthrough is like, and anyone who has had one will be able to agree right off the bat. They probably dont even need to read what I have to say because theyve been there already. There is no explaining it, not in words. There have been so many little sayings that you hear, like;\r\n\n\n\n\u0093DMT finds you\u0094\r\n\n\u0093meeting god/your creator\u0094\r\n\n\u0093if youre not sure whether or not you broke through, you havent\u0094\r\n\n\n\nThe second is particularly true. I had obtained a bit of the stuff because I had really wanted to try it but I cant say that I was in any way prepared to be confronted with what I found down there. I say \u0093down\u0094 there because for me it is just easier. I would say I was mentally more prepared than a lot of people who first try, I wasnt approaching this as any kind of party drug or recreational high. \r\n\n\n\nI did get exactly what I came for though, I just didnt know it back then. First few tries was kind of with whack equipment and the stuff just kind of burned and I got some neat visuals and even had what I thought was a deep experience where I more or less was able to experience emotions that I wasnt familiar with completely and met a very friendly fat furry cat. Also, those first 2 times I tried I did have a bit of guidance etc. but that was a parlour game compared to the breakthrough. \r\n\n\n\nThe difference with the breakthrough hit was that I had a generally more positive experience in the actual taking of the substance, it was very much more enjoyable and not so acrid and disgusting as the first 2 times since my delivery this time was a glass pipe and a nice fat flame on a piezo electric lighter. I used about 30mg each time, because supposedly you can back the dosage off in this pipe. I also had to reload the pipe for a second hit of that thick milky smoke because the first time it completely took me by surprise and I spat a fair bit of it out. \r\n\n\n\nOn the second drawing of the pipe where it was just starting to vaporize I was already breathing in and feeling very spinny and disorientated and kind of getting those odd colours that kind of permeate from everything and the whirring siren in the ears, and then it went and I was well and truly on the way. The incredible thing I can say is just how layered the experience was. I recorded myself for about 20 or 30 minutes afterwards trying to explain it to my girlfriend but probably just came across as a bit of a looney. \r\n\n\n\nOn the layering, what I found incredibly profound was how strong and able to handle more information you become. When people say that its over very quickly, maybe it is because I haven't done it again since writing this, maybe you become more familiar or more able to navigate the space but on that first voyage it really did feel like an eternity. Everything was just right, and I was pulled away from the mind that I was communing with just at the right time. \r\n\n\n\nHow I would describe the thing in its entirety was layers of an onion that got bigger instead of smaller, just immense space and knowledge and understanding of the science and geometry and mathematics and physical properties of an entire universe, an incredible god-like surge of knowledge and control of everything I was taking in, but that was only granted to me once I became intimate with the entity, or the guide in that place. \r\n\n\n\nTo say control of that reality is maybe wrong, I think a better word is an understanding that everything that happened to that reality was eventually going to be ok, I had no scores to settle. Just an entirely enveloping understanding of the space you were in, and then you hadnt even come into the relationship with the entity of that dimension yet. \r\n\n\n\nFor those that have had warm experiences with their mothers, that feeling of complete acceptance and total trust and warmth and everything happy and confronting and non-ego about that relationship we have with our mothers is magnified indefinitely. I had that instant relationship and knowing with the entity the second it peeled back another layer and showed me the reality that was behind the one you I saw and understood and had just been \u0093shown\u0094. And by shown it was as if I became so aware of that dimension that I was completely in tune and able to understand the way things happened down to the last detail in that new place. I try not to make it sound as though it just makes you feel powerful. It completely didnt, it totally humbled me. \r\n\n\n\nI was then shown the nature of the next reality, and the next, each one becoming exponentially more amazing and perfect and completely non-contrived. It was like an infinite meditation with something that permeated every possible dimension and every possible outcome or thought that could potentially exist in any universe that a being could even have the capacity to think of being possible even in the depths of their deepest spiritual experiences. \r\n\n\n\nThat last bit was an attempt at illustrating the layering that I felt. Everything I did, every time I met god it was a life-changing experience that went far beyond words, and then I met him more.  It was the same mind but I simply went deeper into that communion with it. For me this is a bad movie review that completely skips the plot. I met so many layers of this thing and each time I felt that utter god bond that thats why I describe a lot of it as infinite. \r\n\n\n\nThe thing that I was last experiencing when I started coming out of it was what I could only describe as a deep dark blackness with purple lines barely visible on the sides of my vision. The lines were almost like patterns of a waterfall, except very neat and mathematical and understandable. That was just kind of its \u0093overflow\u0094, those lines. It was like maybe staring into a drain as it empties and seeing the water rippling and flowing on the sides. The purple shapes I saw were of no consequence compared to the blackness that I was exchanging emotions with. I felt like I had come all the way to bowser's castle or the emerald city, all the way into the depths of the matrix. But I knew that this could have almost just kept going, now that I think of it. \r\n\n\n\nGiven how much of that feeling that I had every layer I experienced, im sure it could have just gone, all the same entity but all different dimensions that it can conceive of. Obviously, the language of the whole thing was in geometric shapes, that's sort of how I was communicated with. I had an incredibly deep understanding of what I was being shown because each layer or dimension would show me how to speak the mathematical/physical language of that particular reality. \r\n\n\n\nIn terms of visuals, heres how I would put it. Each time I could have tried to visualise what was happening in a way that made sense to an outside listener I might have said (which was, by the way, one strong visual I got) \u0093fat fluffy cat in a yellow raincoat\u0094, that description of that being in particular was only one possibility in that reality. By that logic, the loch ness monster does exist simply because we have thought of it, the thought of it exists in our universe. Therefore, any kind of material object or thing that you visualised at a certain layer of the experience was only one stray possibility that could have emerged in the imagination of somebody in that entire universe.  \r\n\n\n\nThats how my feelings were on it, it wasnt some freak show with these far out creatures, it was being shown entirely new realities where those particular apparitions might only exist in the mind of some creature, or that the physical laws of that reality would allow for that thought to arise within it. Hearing a lot more peoples experiences has been cool as well, but all I see honestly is people having trouble expressing themselves, just as I am. Even the ones who do this stuff a lot and try to talk about it a lot have real dramas even describing the first atom in one of these realities that you completely synchronise with, let alone being able to express what its like to be able to actually walk the yellow brick road and meet the thing behind the curtain. The whole thing was so utterly moving and humbling and empowering and just plain over the top crazy that I could talk about it for years. \r\n\n\n\nAnd I think that that's what ive been looking for. Here are some closing things I said as I was coming down and trying to make some kind of sense of what had just happened to my consciousness;\r\n\n\n\n\u0093They need to have DMT journalists\u0094\r\n\n\u0093it makes you aware of your own reasoning\u0094\r\n\n\u0093can you create something in your own mind that you are totally unfamiliar with?\u0094"

        "report_text": "I had carefully experimented with many drugs including Marijuana, LSD, mushrooms, cactus, mdma, ketamine, morning glory seeds and several others. I had gone far with some of these substances and always found my way back with insight and experience gained. I had read the book 'The Spirit Molecule' about DMT as well as listened to many of Terence McKenna's lectures and read some of his writings.\r\n\n\n\nMy friend R acquired enough DMT for substantial experimentation. My friends and I were all psychonauts and always researched and proceeded with caution before experimenting with new substances. After much reading on the subject we decided that DMT was nothing to play around and that we should begin very carefully with very light doses.\r\n\n\n\nI smoked 'light' doses of DMT on about 4 separate occasions, taking a cautious, small puff from a pipe. Each time was profound and unnerving as if I was glimpsing something I wasn't supposed to see. On one occasion I got an impression of golden shimmering heiroglyphics. On another I seemed to feel that I was in an operating room, surrounded by doctors. It took me days after each of these 'light' experiences to work up the courage to try it again.\r\n\n\n\nOne night we were passing the bowl with DMT-infused damiana. My friends R and K were each starting slow, taking light puffs. When it was my turn, on a whim, I decided to go all out with a breathing technique I call the 'Zen Bong Technique'. I took an impossibly large hit... slowly burning almost the entire bowl, breathing the thick, chemical-tasting smoke in deeply. My friends exchanged looks of surprise, then looked at me with raised eyebrows, curious what would happen. I was about to go further than any of us had. I sort've shrugged at them as if to say, 'Eh, you know, might as well!' I thought I was ready to see what this drug was all about. Yeah, sure...\r\n\n\n\nAbout this time I felt the beginning of the wave... I realized, 'Oh shit, this is about to get serious.' I exhaled and leaned forward to hand the pipe to R, knowing that I had seconds before I was in DEEP. As I leaned forward the chair I was sitting in snapped and broke and I stumbled forward onto the concrete.\r\n\n\n\nR started yelling at me about breaking his chair just as I launched into hyperspace. This, I believe, contributed to the effects which followed, in addition to the state of my life in general. Either way, it hit me - or I hit it. 'It' was a giant fractal stained glass window, deep emerald green. I shot out through my third eye, blasting through the emerald veil like a bullet. My body slumped onto the concrete spread-eagle but I was in a different universe.\r\n\n\n\nWhat happened next was stunning. My life flashed before my eyes... But it wasn't how I thought it would be. It was in the form of photographs - real photographs that actually exist - that I've seen, in chronological order. First I saw a photo of myself as an infant being held by my parents. As quickly as I saw it it was replaced by next photo. I was a little older, held by my Dad. These are real photos that exist in various family albums. I watched myself aging... It was very surreal. There was a photo of me and my sister watching TV. A photo of us playing in the park. A photo of me in a white tuxedo in church for first communion. They came faster and faster, photo after photo. Time was speeding up. I saw a picture my sister had taken of her, my Dad, and I on a ski-lift together. More and more. I saw what seemed like 50-100 pictures.\r\n\n\n\nThe final picture I saw was a picture I had taken myself. I had been doing a lot of drugs and was homeless and living in a tent. I took the picture of myself in front of this tent, looking disheveled, unhappy, like a loser who had wasted his life and thrown away his family.\r\n\n\n\nThe contrast of that bright smiling face of the young kid in the white tuxedo to the unshaven, unkempt, drugged out hippie in front of his tent seemed to sum up my life's trajectory.\r\n\n\n\nThis was death, after all. There was no going back. I remember thinking, 'Oh my God...'\r\n\n\n\nThe final picture fell away - some 2-3 seconds after the breaking through the veil - and I was in Hell. Just infinity, solitude, with my pain and failures echoing around me. I felt the presence of God but in an impersonal sort of way. It wasn't like I was being punished. The transition from life to death was the transition from the finite to the infinite. My finite failures became infinite. It was natural. This was the fate I had chosen - what all my life had led up to. All of my decisions, my state of mind, were multiplied times infinity.\r\n\n\n\nThe nature of the Hell I experienced is difficult to describe. I was in a tremendously large volume of space... All fractal chaos. There are various impressions of my body being torqued and twisted at absurd speeds into incomprehensible angles, spinning, twisting, rocketing through space. I have this memory of a face - my face - protruding out of the surface of an infinite, featureless plain, my eyes spinning madly in their sockets while a thousand different and pained expressions played across the features of my face. But these are just symbols, fragmented impressions of what really happened.\r\n\n\n\nI don't believe being burned alive at the stake would be a more distressing experience.\r\n\n\n\nEach moment of this was the first moment. It was like being born into hell each moment. In that sense it was eternity. I had already been there for eternity. I need to emphasize that word - ETERNITY. That's different then 'a long time' or 'a thousand years' or 'a million years'. Eternity is FOREVER. It was a place more fundamental than this 3D waking life - a place where I had always been. It was beyond time.\r\n\n\n\nFinally the absurdity began to slow. As I began to come down I was sure that I was brain-damaged. I knew I had destroyed myself. I wanted to tell my sister not to make the same mistakes I had made. I needed to talk to her. I crawled on the ground into the house, looking for a phone. My friends followed me, trying to calm me down. A few minutes later, when I had finally come down a bit more, my friends asked me what I had experienced.\r\n\n\n\nAll I could say, frantically and amazed, was, 'I exist? I exist! I exist! This exists. I exist! Oh my God, I exist!'\r\n\n\n\nAs I came down even more I became euphoric that I had made it back. I was grinning, almost crying. I couldn't believe I had survived.\r\n\n\n\nStill... I was a different person for 4 months. I experienced profound mood swings. Sometimes reality would suddenly lose its emotional content. In a crowded room, for example, instead of seeing people in front of me, I would see 'matter', no different from rocks. I saw bodies engaged in activities but no sense of humanity to them. These experiences would last a few seconds and were rather disconcerting. The DMT imagery also affected other psychedelic use. Eating Cactus, doing mushrooms, even smoking weed would bring back images that I hadn't been able to integrate. Images of my own personal Hell. Over the months these issues faded away as I integrated the experience. Over the months these issues faded away as I integrated the experience. I have since grown to be thankful for what I experienced, even though it still makes me shudder to think about some of the deeper aspects of the trip.\r\n\n\n\nIt's been two years now. I'll never be the same of course. I no longer have any doubt that I am an eternal being - this is a certainty to me now. I value my life immensely in a different way than I ever have could before. It was something I was meant to experience and has drastically affected my choices. In four days I'm going back to college. I've still got my problems... But I'm doing something with my life, whatever that is. Maybe DMT has something to do with that.\r\n\n\n\nI'll likely never smoke DMT again because frankly I don't believe that's how it's 'meant' to be consumed. I will very likely consume ayahuasca in a traditional ceremony in the near future. I even expect to find my way back to 'Hell'. I have unfinished business there. But I'm hoping to ease my way into that realm in a way that's more workable than going from 0 to 5000mph in 14 seconds AKA 5 minutes of hardcore tripping, peaking harder than you've ever comprehended was possible.\r\n\n\n\nSo in short... Make sure you have a sturdy chair when you smoke DMT."

        "report_text": "N,N-DMT - via solution of 30% Propylene Glycol, 70% Vegetable Glycerin\r\n\n\n\nAbstract & Personal Background:\r\n\nN,N-DMT (DMT) in its freebase form is known to be soluble in propylene glycol (PG). With the emergence of electronic cigarettes (E-cigs, or vapes) and a wide variety of 'juices' available, there's a degree of variance of PG - I read that 30-50% PG is usually a good amount.\r\n\n\n\nDMT was my first psychedelic, and probably the one I have the most experience with. I have been making it and consulted on its manufacture for about 5.5 years, with countless DMT trips under my belt, and a handful of memorable ones, and many friendships made along the way. My main method of smoking was the 'sandwich' method (DMT between layers of leafy substrate) before I discovered this way. Now, I don't think I'll go back to the old ways.\r\n\n\n\n--- Prep Work ---\r\n\n\n\nMethod and equipment:\r\n\n\n\nI had recently extracted a large quantity of DMT using a straight-to-base technique from Mimosa Hostilis Rootbark (MHRB) to ensure I only got N,N-DMT as the primary alkaloid. From ~100 grams of finely shredded and powdered MHRB, 2.25 grams of DMT freebase crystals were yielded, mainly white, with a trace yellow at parts, and no tan.\r\n\n\n\nThe vape fluid I had chosen was one of 70% VG, 30% PG, mint flavored (to mask the strong flavor of DMT), with 0% nicotine to keep the experience pure. It was the highest PG the shop had in that flavor. I used a tank with a stainless steel coil, on a temperature controlled device designed to handle stainless steel coils. The temperature was set to 520 degrees Fahrenheit at 60.0 Watts. I used an 80W power mod, which was chosen for its high capacity internal battery and temperature control settings. I primed the coil with the fluid and ensured its full saturation before adding DMT-laden fluid to the tank.\r\n\n\n\nThe tank has the advantage of being easy to fill and add DMT to. While the tank was not completely full, I proceeded to slowly and carefully add 400mg of DMT to 3mL of e-cig fluid. Initially, the DMT did not dissolve immediately, stuck to the top of the tank's edges (which reminded me of how margaritas are served with salt on the rim), and it appeared to be somewhat of a sludge in the mixture. I ran hot water over the tank and shook it vigorously and rotated it frequently until some of the larger particles began to dissolve. Upon firing the pre-soaked coil and taking a couple test hits, the solution cleared up and the DMT was fully dissolved. The solution turned from clear/white to a light pale yellow.\r\n\n\n\nAlternatively, I would recommend mixing the e-cig fluid and DMT in a test tube, and gently heating it until it's dissolved, and preparing a sort of 'Mother Liquor' through this manner. \r\n\n\n\n---  Experience ---\r\n\n\n\n1st puff - I inhale for about 3 to 5 seconds, and hold for about 5 to 8. I taste mainly mint, and I am not sure if the DMT has vaporized sufficiently. I faintly smell it and taste it on the exhale, but what I mainly taste and smell is mint. It feels like I'm inhaling peppermint mouthwash. I feel the effects faintly.\r\n\n\n\n2nd puff - I inhale as I did before. This time, the smell of the DMT was a little stronger, but not by much. The taste was not significantly different from the previous hit. I feel the effects a bit more heavily, and get a hint or idea that it doesn't behave the same way as burning it in a bowl (sandwiched between two layers) does. The effects creep up, then intensify somewhat.\r\n\n\n\n3rd puff - The smell of DMT did not change from the last hit, nor did the taste. The effects become much more pronounced, as does the way it hits me. It has somewhat of a delayed effect, which I suspect is from the PG - I think the PG dissolves in the lungs first, and then the DMT follows shortly after. It would explain the 'ramped' and lagged/delayed feeling I get. It seems like the DMT will begin to be felt a couple seconds after the inhale, but doesn't fully kick in until about 5-10 seconds later. It is important to take the hits back-to-back, so as to meet the time frame for the DMT breakthrough. The ringing in my ears begins to become more apparent.\r\n\n\n\n4th & 5th puffs - Feels the same as earlier inhaling, but I inhale differently and more deeply, holding my breath a bit longer. These puffs hit harder than the first three. I exhale, and take the 5th puff identically as I can to the 4th. As I am closing my eyes, I begin to feel the 4th puff slam me. Then I thought about that 5th puff I just took, and the amount of time delay between the two was the same time delay between the slammed/ramped feels of it. The ringing in my ears from the 3rd puff intensified significantly after the 4th puff, and by the time the 5th puff hit, it was almost the ringing got loud for a quick moment, then stopped. I think I broke through.\r\n\n\n\nTime dilated significantly by this point, and I felt in awe at what I had created. The background on my computer looked cartoonish, and I could not convince myself that the trees I was seeing in it weren't cell-shaded. The clock seemed to hang at 1:10AM for what felt like hours, and I looked at the tie-dye tapestry on my wall, and saw many geometric patterns of arrows pointing towards its center. Closed-eye visuals were as complex and stunning as they were beautiful. 1:11am went by more quickly than 1:10 did. By 1:20am, I was feeling mostly back to normal.\r\n\n\n\n---\r\n\n\n\nExtensions and commentary: I think this is really a game-changer in a lot of ways. It's discrete and stealthy, it's very convenient and easy to use, and it's much easier and more reliable to break through this way than any other method I have tried. I wish I had made it at 500mg/3mL instead of 400mg. Temperature control means you run a much lower risk of burning your DMT. \r\n\n\n\nIt's really slick in a lot of ways, and the only downside I see is the lag effect can creep up on newbies with the lag/delay response from hitting it."

        "report_text": "PREFACE:\r\n\n\n\nI am a long-time (30+ year) psychedelics/entheogenics user (including a number of major high/\u0093heroic\u0094-dose experiences under supervision of both of my shamanic teachers). In the past, I have used LSD, mescaline, MDMA, 2C-B, Nitrous Oxide, Heroin, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Adderall (by prescription), mushrooms, Ketamine, and many others, as well as being a daily user of cannabis/hash. I am also a formal practicing Zen Buddhist of 15 years, with a long-standing practice rooted in zazen/shikantaza. Having said all that, I don\u0092t want to come off as claiming to have my psychic shit in a pile more than anybody else: I merely state that I have a pretty good grasp of my personal psychology, my mind, my body, and my spirit.\u00a0 Even so, I have had brief periods of over-use, but for the most part, I treat these compounds as medicines for the mind, heart, and spirit, and approach them with respect.\r\n\n\n\n\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\r\n\nI was gifted a small quantity of DMT powder by a close friend. Unlike the last supply I\u0092d gotten, which looked to be a very crude home extraction, this powder was very clean looking, homogenous, and of a light fawn color. Unfortunately, neither my friend nor I could discern what flavor of DMT it was (N,N- or 5-MeO-) so I figured that it was going to take me tasting it to suss that out.\r\n\n\n\nOddly enough, it was me who introduced N,N-DMT to that same friend a few years earlier. Back then, I didn\u0092t have much by way of a proper DMT set-up; the powder was either placed between dried mint leaves and smoked raw, or later, to help keep it from burning, loaded into a crude hand-and-lighter vaporizer rig. The experiences were valuable, but of very low threshold. Some mild, interesting visuals, but nothing astounding. It did, however, teach us both that there was something great and majestic awaiting us in this compound.\r\n\n\n\nSo, about a month ago, I decided that I should at least try and suss out what type of DMT I\u0092d been gifted. I was hoping for N,N-DMT, and I figured that with an extremely low dose, I should be able to sense which it was if the body sensation (for me, it always felt like I\u0092d climbed into an elevator, hit the \u0093up\u0094 button, but inexplicably started going \u0093down\u0094 rather abruptly) was present, without launching myself into hyperspace. Having found an unused glass vapor bulb (aka \u0093meth pipe\u0094) in my hash oil kit a few days earlier that fit my favorite water pipe, I believed I\u0092d gathered the perfect set-up. So one Friday night as my girlfriend and I readied for bed, I told her that I wanted to do it, and would she mind spotting for me. I told her a bit about the substance, what she could possibly expect of me if I wound up going further than I\u0092d planned, some safety reassurances, etc, etc. I told her the chances of me being \u0093gone\u0094 were low, but not zero, and if I got more from it than I\u0092d planned, I\u0092d just have to roll with it.\r\n\n\n\nSo, with a tiny (think \u0093head of a stick-pin\u0094) amount loaded into the bulb, I climbed into bed with her, gave her a kiss, and said \u0093Well, let\u0092s see what I can see, huh?\u0094\r\n\n\n\nI used a butane torch to heat the bulb, and got a minuscule whiff of gray-white smoke, barely noticeable, filling the bulb. I drew it into my lungs, held it for as long as I was comfortable, then exhaled. The distinct \u0093burning plastic\u0094 odor was present, but besides that, I had no noticeable effects, and said so. I waited ten-or-so minutes, to let whatever DMT I had in my system metabolize out, and loaded the bulb again. This time the amount I placed in the pipe was about the amount (by volume) that looked the size of a sesame seed. I torched it, and could see it readily melt into an amber-ish liquid quite readily, then into an off-white mist. I inhaled deeply, help my breath for about 20 seconds, then exhaled. Seeing no vapor, and barely tasting anything upon exhalation, I thought I may have low-balled it again, and was about to say \u0093That\u0092s it for tonight\u0094 when suddenly, to my amazement, I was struck by a feeling of profound majesty the likes of which I still find hard to describe. I knew I was off, and tried to communicate that to her, but all I could say was \u0093Oh\u0085 oh, wow! Wow. Lights! Get the lights!\u0094\u2028\u2028I was utterly dumbfounded. I thought for sure I\u0092d barely have gotten any in me.\r\n\n\n\nI was very, very wrong.\r\n\n\n\n\u2028\u2028In the darkness, before me flayed open all of reality. It was as if I was the center of the Universe, and everywhere I looked, I could see the gently throbbing, pulsing machinery that underlies the fabric of spacetime. On one hand, they were slightly crystalline, and on the other, very soft and organic. As I let the fractals coalesce and tick away like the most intricate of watch mechanisms, I saw before my eyes a flow of pipes (or what at least looked like pipes), tubes, and wires, They moved, weaving themselves together into a larger, more singular column, not unlike a fluted Doric column in an ancient Greek ruin, with these tubes forming the fluting of the length of the column, but at places crossing over themselves. A sparkling, colorful energy seemed to pulse and flow through them as if the tubes that made up this column themselves were transparent. A moment later, and I suddenly could see that they were not tubes at all. They *were* that flowing energy. And as my view of it/them clarified and sharpened, I could see that each glowing, twinkling light of that energy was a numerical digit, a 1, 3, 0, 2, 7, 4, and on and on, flowing endlessly, continuously, eternally. Each digit, a different, glowing translucent, almost fluorescent, color. I was simply amazed.\r\n\n\n\nIt was breathtaking.\u2028\u2028\r\n\n\n\nMore than amazed, I was truly speechless. This gave a whole new meaning to the word \u0093breathtaking\u0094. I remember hearing myself exhale very slowly and intentionally over and over again as the experience kept building up, and was comforted by that sound. I remember hearing myself exhale very slowly and intentionally over and over again as the experience kept building up, and was comforted by that sound. \u0093Well, at least I\u0092m still breathing!\u0094 I remember saying to myself.\u2028\u2028\r\n\n\n\nSpeaking of internal dialogue, I also remembered being quite surprised at how lucid I remained. I could distinctly hear myself narrate this experience to myself. My ego was along for the ride, was still functioning rather well, and was actually having quite a pleasant time of it.\r\n\n\n\nI remember saying to myself \u0093How utterly alien this feels! How utterly alien, yet somehow, comforting and oddly familiar. This place, these things stand outside of space and time, yet they feel familiar. In my core, I know this place. I know this place...and it knows me.\u0094\r\n\n\n\nOpening my eyes, the room was pitch dark, save for the dim light of the stairwell (which for some reason gave off a slightly sinister energy). Every shape I could see seemed completely and abjectly alien to my mind. It was starting to make me feel a bit uncomfortable, and I had a moment of that all-too-familiar-to-psychonauts anxiety, where you say \u0093When will this get back to normal? Am I stuck here?\u0094 I closed my eyes again, and\u0097while letting the ambient music wash over me\u0097I simply reminded myself that I only had one hit, and that at maximum, the experience couldn\u0092t last more than 20 minutes. It felt like 40 had already passed, but I simply relaxed into it as best I could, and watched the crystalline colors spin and tick-tock in their Mandelbrot majesty.\r\n\n\n\nI suddenly but gently heard my ego/narrator chime in, reassuring me \u0093It will all come back together again\u0094 a number of times. I then realized that this was being told to \u0093me\u0094 on more than one level. In the most gross, obvious way, it was being said to reassure me that baseline would once again be reached. On another, more spiritual level, I was feeling that I was being told that all life energy returns to the vast ocean of consciousness from whence it had come, and this gave me both comfort of spirit, and a shiver of gnosis that so often goes with revelation. On the greatest cosmic scale, though, I somehow knew that I was being told internally\u0097from a knowing, yet somehow external point-of-view\u0097that one of the grand prize questions of physics (id est; \u0093How will the Universe end?\u0094) is answered by these six words, and yet not. I suddenly realized that the question was wrong by one word. The use of \u0093end\u0094 presupposes a result, an outcome, that is wholly and totally subjective, and not only subjective, but relative. How does something that has the infinite and eternal built into its very fabric ever truly \u0093end\u0094? We may be headed for a \u0093Big Crunch\u0094, a \u0093Big Rip\u0094, or a \u0093Big Bounce\u0094 as theorists postulate, but in some way\u0097some yet-to-be-discovered manner\u0097all energy and all matter will reunite, and continue on. This realization overwhelmed me at first, then gave me great comfort. I let it float freely in my mind for a moment, and relaxed.\r\n\n\n\nAfter what seemed like forever, I decided I\u0092d better say something to my girlfriend to let her know I was okay after having been silent for so very, very long.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093I\u0092m\u0085 I\u0092m\u0085 okay. I\u0092m just\u0085 letting this\u0085 happen.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Okay, honey. I\u0092m right here.\u0094\r\n\n\n\nShe took my hand and placed it on her breast. It felt like it was covered in cold honey. It was comforting.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Can you describe what you\u0092re seeing?\u0094 she asked.\r\n\n\n\nI sort of stammered.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093I\u0085 I\u0085 No. Not yet.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Are you seeing colors?\u0094\r\n\n\n\nI stayed silent. Another eternity later, and I could feel myself reintegrating with this gross reality.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093I\u0092m sorry I was silent for so long. I\u0092m sorry that took so long. I hope you weren\u0092t worried too badly,\u0094 I said apologetically, still buzzing and ringing with this alien energy.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Long? It wasn\u0092t *that* long.\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093How long was I silent?\u0094 I asked.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093About three minutes,\u0094 she replied.\r\n\n\n\nThis hit me like a truck.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Shut the front door! THREE MINUTES?\u0094 I exclaimed.\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Yup,\u0094 she replied. \u0093The entire thing was probably only eight minutes long\u0085\u0094\r\n\n\n\nI buzzed inside at hearing this. Powder the size of a small seed. Barely noticeable smoke. Negligible on the palate. Suddenly able to see through the fabric of spacetime, and taste infinity with every breath. And I know very well that I hadn\u0092t even \u0093broken through\u0094. This was but a glimpse.\r\n\n\n\nI tried to explain what happened, where I went, what I saw, but the best I could really do was go \u0093Uhhh\u0085 well, uhh, wow, gosh, uhhh\u0085\u0094\r\n\n\n\nThe discussion closed for the night with her again asking \u0093Did you see\u0085 colors?\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\u0093Colors?\u0094 I replied. \u0093Colors? *Colors?* The word \u0091colors\u0092 is an insult to what I saw\u0085\u0094\r\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY:\r\n\n\n\nThe above could easily be looked at as a completely glowing experience, and in most ways, it most certainly was for me. But there are a number of important things to point out in, or take away from, this experience that I would like the reader to take very seriously as potential modifiers and down-regulators:\r\n\n\n\nAs I said in the preface, I am an experienced explorer, and by that, I mean that I have had the great benefit of having studied under two excellent teachers of both psychedelics and neo-shamanism. One was a credentialed psychological clinician, and the other a very well regarded alternative therapist/LCSW. Add to that that I have had significant practice in identification and reduction of ego attachment through formal practice of Zen Buddhism with a world-renowned Roshi (including multiple long-form silent monastic retreats, or \u0093seshin\u0094 at a number of monasteries, sitting silent meditation for an average of 8 hours a day for at times a week or more). Again, this is not to inflate myself. This is to contextualize my take on this experience. I know full well that were this experience to have happened, say, 30 years ago, it would have blown my doors right off. This was one of the top five psycho-spiritual experiences of my entire life, and I know that were I not to have had the training I am blessed to have accumulated in my life, the potential for this experience to have gone existentially negative (sharply and quickly, I might add) is rather high, but it could also have easily resulted in a potentially psyche-damaging experience, as well, and with potentially long-term personality and cognitive repercussions.\r\n\n\n\nIt is also important to note that while very spiritual, this experience was more deeply rooted in\u0097for lack of a better descriptor\u0097\u0093science-mind\u0094 for me. It is so very easy to get all \u00fcber-hippie/new-agey about experiences of consciousness that certain compounds may help manifest, with the vivid imagery, hyper-awareness, feelings of euphoria, supposed glimpses of the cosmic, the eternal, etc, etc. It can all get very \u0093woo-woo\u0094, and easily sweep the psychonaut away to patchouli-scented realms out beyond the river Alph that are less attached to day-to-day reality, and more mere fantasy. \r\n\n\n\nI find no use whatsoever to that tack, nor to the use of substances that induce such \u0093paltry amusements\u0094, as I call them. I employ these compounds in my life to explore consciousness, however it truly is. I try and explore the moment as it is; whole, total, and complete, lacking nothing. If\u0097after use of a given compound\u0097in the next day or two that follows, I do not feel more integrated with and connected to *this* life than I did before the experience (or, say, more than or equal to a long meditation session), I normally do not care to go back to the compound in question. To do so is a distraction from this moment, and I have taken vows in a number of spiritual traditions to not needlessly \u0093cloud my mind\u0094, but to look for a way to practice with each and every moment I have access to in this life, for the benefit of all sentient beings. That which provides me with an experience that jibes with my mind\u0092s appreciation of science (and this experience most certainly did) tends to have \u0093more legs\u0094 for me.\r\n\n\n\nI could paint you very pretty psychedelic pictures of what I saw, but to what end? They are not likely to be the things you would see, or feel what you feel, so to do so, I believe, would be unhelpful at best, and potentially damaging; setting up externally gestated preconceptions of a wholly subjective experience that, while it may share some select aesthetically common elements, is still completely individualistic in both its expression, and its greater \u0093meaning\u0094 in a person\u0092s life. That which is beautiful and awe-inspiring to me may in fact be horrifying to you, much in the same way that the works of certain artists, writers, and musicians (H. R. Giger, Lovecraft, Philip Glass, et al) are found ugly, morbid, grotesque, and depressing to some, but truly beautiful, inspiring, and life-affirming to others. I say all this to restate and reinforce that the magnitude of this experience can be off-the-charts (even at the small dose I took) and to take from one or two internet \u0093trip reports\u0094 the notion that one has performed due diligence and can \u0093know what to expect\u0094 is not only foolish, but potentially dangerous.\r\n\n\n\nDMT is an amazing molecule that insists upon the highest levels of respect. To use it in a cavalier manner for \u0093a trippy time, dude\u0094 is either intellectual na\u00efvet\u00e9 at its most unbridled, or its most hubristic. This is a phenomenally powerful teacher, and no matter where one is in life\u0092s journey, it *will* teach you a lesson. Just don\u0092t be surprised if that lesson was \u0093You\u0092re not ready for me yet\u0085\u0094\r\n\n\n\nI know that I am not yet ready for that second hit. It will take me a good long while to process *this* experience. To rush back would be like trying to master calculus after just learning how to add and subtract.\r\n\n\n\nTread very carefully, friends."

        "report_text": "This was my third attempt at DMT. My first and second attempts were startling as my body began to vibrate all over with uncanny energy. The room began to resonate along with what was happening to my body. Everything took on a shimmering, almost plastic quality. A sound came through almost like a metronome set to a high setting (although not quite annoying like a metronome tick), as if through the matter of the room itself, shut out everything. I felt that if I took another hit, as I knew I would have to in order to break through to hyperspace, I would be sucked out of my body. From what I\u0092ve heard, the experience is tantamount to an OBE. \r\n\n\n\nI panicked a little, fearing that it was going to be something similar to a bad experience I\u0092d had when I tried salvia a few months prior. In that experience I\u0092d been \u0093transported\u0094 to some place where I lost all sense of self and couldn\u0092t get out. I didn\u0092t want to bring anything like that upon myself again; I couldn\u0092t bring myself to take another hit on either the first or second try. Instead, I leaned back in the recliner and closed my eyes, enjoying very briefly a series of images flickering on a panel that very much resembled a slot machine. But rather than three slots there were many, and I was zoomed in on just a fraction of the full \u0093blueprint\u0094 of whatever language this was. The symbols/motifs didn\u0092t roll down, they transformed from one into another, so quickly that even if I understood the language, I wouldn\u0092t have been able to make sense of what I was seeing. \r\n\n\n\nBut I was yearning to experience hyperspace, and I\u0092d done a lot of work to extract what little DMT I had. I was yearning to experience hyperspace, and I\u0092d done a lot of work to extract what little DMT I had. I couple of days later I set up about 25-30mg on a spoon within a very crudely improvised device that I could use to melt the chemical from underneath and breathe the vapor through a funnel on top. I put some Vaseline on my lips and in my mouth to try and protect it (I burned the top of my lip the second time), although this didn\u0092t really help much. \r\n\n\n\nI began to melt the DMT and breath through the funnel. I built up puffs of smoke slowly, trying to hold each for as long as I could. The first three times produced very little (the device wasn\u0092t very efficient), but by the fourth hit, when I finally got a lungful of smoke, the familiar sensations were beginning to overtake me. I forced myself to hold in the fourth, and then took the fifth as my body grew incredibly heavy and the room began to change. Even as I was holding the fifth and burning more, I could no longer hear the sizzling of the DMT in the spoon. Then I could no longer move my body at all and I stopped trying. I leaned back and, still holding the last big breath, saw everything on the table and the computer desk shimmering, melting, and fading away all at the same time. \r\n\n\n\nI closed my eyes and saw swirls upon swirls of color and energy. Everything was happening so fast I knew I wouldn\u0092t be able to remember any of this. I probably could have done a much better job had I not been desperately trying to hold on to my sense of self. I know from reading about it that failure to let go is antithetical to really getting a lot out of the experience. So while these unspeakable vignettes, fractals and orbs were flying toward me, grasping and pulling upon my consciousness, stroking the core of my awareness, I was trying to scramble back to my body. Such a mistake. I wish I\u0092d stopped fighting it, stopped saying to myself, \u0093See I\u0092m still me\u0085 somewhere in all this stream of willy-nilly, psychedelic information\u0085 I\u0092m still me. Still me. See\u0085 there I am\u0085 that thought is from me, even while all of this is happening. How can I think like that when all of this is going on\u0097doesn\u0092t that mean that everything out there that I\u0092m seeing is NOT me?\u0094 \r\n\n\n\nI suppose like many of those who are starting out with DMT, they worry that they won\u0092t be able to get back to their bodies. But even in the worry I noticed that there was someone in the midst of the kaleidoscope. It wasn\u0092t an immediate realization. I began to see a transparent sphere (with translucent edges) and a glowing, pulsing orange \u0093life force\u0094 within, leaping to and fro in my vision. Manipulating the egg-like orbs from behind, and above, and the sides, was this person. I never saw a face, but I saw enough of his body to know that he was naked (there was no evidence of gender, although he seemed masculine) and his arms were pumping madly, touching the sphere, rolling the sphere, squeezing the sphere. The weirdest thing of all was that he seemed to be doing it for my benefit. He was trying to show me something, to change me through the spherical egg. By the time I became fully conscious of all this, I was all too-soon slipping away from it, reluctantly now re-entering myself. \r\n\n\n\nI sat in the chair, found it difficult to move my limbs. But then I realized that I didn\u0092t want to move just yet. I sat there for some time trying to recollect what I\u0092d just seen. I feel that somehow, I missed the most important part of it while I was too busy trying to reassure myself that I was still me. \r\n\n\n\nA few things came to me in afterthought. The old compulsion I\u0092ve had in earlier years, when I was much happier, to organize my \u0093world\u0094 has come back. I hope it stays with me. I feel that it is not so much the neurotic need to control my space as it is to have everything laid out and categorized so I can make better sense of it and increase my understanding of life. I have looked through a lot of things and experimented very much with states of consciousness lately, but I still feel that I am only scratching the surface of what it means to be alive in this physical world. I suspect that our place  here is tremendously important (and how lucky we are to be apart of it!). \r\n\n\n\nI know that part of this urge is a direct reaction to the inability to make sense of what I just saw. It was pure data presented to me in such a way that my brain could only interpret as chaos. Now that I\u0092m back, I feel compelled to make sense of the things that are within my capacity to understand. One of the best ways of doing this is to keep a journal. In high school I kept a huge journal that nearly reached 300 pages at one point. It is unfortunate that I can no longer look back on this, reflect and learn from where my mind was at that point, because in a fit of shame and self-incrimination, I deleted it. Now I want to continue using a journal through an electronic medium, but without strict rules about what should go into it and why."

        "report_text": "[Reported Dose: 400mg DMT and 8-10g Syrian Rue seed tea]  \r\n\n\n\nThe following is my best chronological account of coming into the mystery of a Pharmahuasca-driven ego-shedding experience. I'll say this concerning my experience; it\u0092s something I will not forget in this lifetime. I\u0092d love to share and include as many details as I can, but we have yet to find words for much of this experience and this venue demands a certain focus. These stories and experiences, I am evolving to seek and tell effectively. Here goes nothing...or everything.\r\n\n\n\nA DMT and Peganum Harmala brew + 1 vapor hit, is the catalyst of my experience. I worked up about 300-450mg of an oral dose of DMT (This weight included the 2 capsules and drop of citrus added to each). The MAOI was approx. 10G of a Syrian Rue boil (I did not take in the seed, so may equate to less. It was a 7-10 minute boil). Confident in my only concern, (a lack of deaths on DMT) I would be braving this experience\u0085ALONE. Experience and later research showed me - I was possibly within the dangers of serotonin syndrome. There were moments within 3 days after the experience that had me concerned (described later). \r\n\n\n\nConcerning my motives, a few prior experiences had me curious to go further than before. Though their level of novelty was close to the following experience, there was an undiscovered dissolution to be beheld. Set and setting was largely my isolated thoughts and a house once occupied by some people very important to me. In this alone-ness I was comfortable, the temperature and humidity was pleasant. I was primarily found seated in my bed or laying on my back. I have always gone it alone exploring in this way. Though that exploration be limited, it includes (included): Cannabis use, honeymooner NMT+Peganum Harmala use, and finally DMT+light peganum harmala (for its additional color and ancient archetypal flavoring). I had until this point and still to some degree, believe in an omnipotent being that may or may not be completely entwined in my own being. This had largely played in the experience to follow.\r\n\n\n\nAt about 10PM I had made the knee-jerk commitment (Yes, I had to essentially trick myself and be so na\u00efve to take this quantum leap of experience). At 10:45, encapsulated DMT went down the hatch in two parts - 1st at about 45mins after the tea, then 60mins. I tossed aside the thought of 'Oh dear God, what have I done' for the time being. For the first 40mins, approaching the vision threshold, the standard visuals took some coaxing to come forward. I was for about 15 minutes stuck in the \u0091grids\u0092. \r\n\n\n\nLittle did I know, my lack of orally administered experience was the only road block. My experiences largely consisted of oral MAOI via Syrian Rue, followed by well-timed vaporized \u0091spice\u0092. Some MAOI-safe food was in order. This included:  a few bites of fresh-fully cooked ham (ounces worth), a tbsp of mustard, a handful of grapes (5-10), and a piece of a clementine (less than half). Within 15 minutes my insides became quite warm. \r\n\n\n\nAt this point, with angst and impatience I also took one mild vapor draw from my backup plan, in case nothing happened. Vapor genie aside and breathing out I had the quick sensation: \u0093Here we go, its moving up!\u0094 Not in a nauseous way but a rushing pressure, a pre-headache-knot-in-your-neck kind of way. All the neurotransmitters were partying in my gut too, making their way north. \u0091Lord knows\u0092 what my liver thought of this whole ordeal.  An omnipresence of light was starting around the edges of my vision, accompanying the pressure. A shimmering was taking to the once subdued visuals of my closed eye and something was finally happening. Sweet! \r\n\n\n\nI began to feel a rush of \u0091data\u0092 overwhelm my senses, beyond the knot in my neck. The aura like shimmering, as I can best describe, was quite bright open/closed eye. Upon focus on the closed eye vision, I saw what appeared to be skyscraper crowned gears. It could\u0092ve also been described as castle like crenulations atop gear teeth. This was fine and dandy, but I was forgetting to focus/pay attention. Similarly, something new I had never felt was infused here. It felt like I was more than just myself. I would use a term which I think is widely misused and misunderstood here-schizophrenia. I felt as if channel surfing was beginning to take place on a level of personality and my behavior. I felt as if channel surfing was beginning to take place on a level of personality and my behavior. Admittedly, this was never noticeable with vaporized experiences, perhaps because one seems to quickly waltz right through the experience. In this case, I had to \u0093sit down for a coffee with\u0094 whatever was going on here.\r\n\n\n\nI didn\u0092t know what to do with the data, the story being told. The gears and their crenulations were turning in and out of themselves. As if they only took shape protruding from the surface of some superfluid. They would disappear behind the scenes after showing me their full detail at the forward of rotation. I thought this is where I would land until finishing the metaphoric coffee, but there was more in store. \r\n\n\n\nAlways being careful with my consciousness, \u0093of sound mind\u0094 as we\u0092d call it in our nuclear western culture, I didn\u0092t think this would turn sour. After all, I\u0092ve had fanatical and ecstatic experiences (vaporized) at this point. Like, \u0093This place knows me, and I know it. Now we\u0092ll be even more initiated. I\u0092ll learn so much, it\u0092ll be fun, sexy and embrace me\u0085\u0094 While that statement is true, this experience reminded me harshly, \u0093There are lessons waiting-yet, don\u0092t get ahead of yourself(myself)\u0094.\r\n\n\n\nSome notes on movement for me with these \u0091neurotransmitter substances\u0092: I was a diagnosed \u0091ADHD\u0092 child growing up. It is known certain substances affect the mind and nervous system differently in cases like this and similar. Like these cases, I was surprisingly \u0091with it and mobile\u0092. This same phenomenon was evident in vaporized administration. I took some layers of clothes off and covered on my bed to get comfortable. Things were rubbery and attempts at correcting my setting difficult. However, I would continue moving throughout. \r\n\n\n\nThe next 10 minutes extinguished my angst and childlike excitement. A sound system I had set up caused an annoying 60 cycle hum in the room. I turned it off, bothered by this inconvenience.  I think that moment was a significant turning point, \u0093I shouldn\u0092t have these interruptions!\u0094 I began feeling nagged by this. It spiraled into considering the annoyance many different things, momentarily asking myself or the trip \u0093why do things have to be this way!?\u0094 This didn\u0092t sit well and the visuals/central nervous channel pressure was ramping up fast! Soon after, it showed me what I can only call the most nagging, entangled and persistent neon advertising/propaganda I have ever seen. It was essentially saying \u0093Oh you think that\u0092s annoying? Look at this!\u0094 It was like neon signs shuffling their way to the forefront, each more hell-bent to show themselves than the last. This seemed \u0093so wrapped with consumerism\u0094 it was sickening to me. I was judging it heavily. That may have been a problem.With mixed emotions and judgements, the thoughts were becoming hard to trace. \r\n\n\n\nThe experience was replacing the thoughts. The creeping feeling this concoction presented was not something I\u0092ve ever felt. You can\u0092t \u0091get comfortable\u0092 on the come up. It really feels like the sheering away of boundaries as described others. It appeared reality was being replaced, like the thoughts. The consideration \u0093perhaps thought defines reality\u0094, entered in.  The walls of the room started to flicker in and out of solidity. Literally, there was some sort of flash associated with wandering eyes/a shifting scene. The walls would appear ok for a moment, fall behind a fog, and upon eye movement - a flash! They came right back into focus. \r\n\n\n\nSome minutes pass and the moment doesn\u0092t feel \u0091well\u0092. \u0093I feel like collapsing.\u0094 It\u0092s like being exhausted and energized at the same time, like being spread thin. \u0093Is this a side effect of my fears? I\u0092ve never felt this on DMT\u0085with or without Syrian Rues help\u0085\u0094 I wondered if replacing my neurology forcedly with these chemicals, would actually stop my brain and my heart. It was classic, but terrible for those moments. It felt hopeless. Like I\u0092d screwed up and was going to lose consciousness or worse. At this moment I looked around, grabbed my phone and tried to operate it\u0085 \u0093I swear, I\u0092ve pushed the wake-up button properly and am swiping to unlock. Why isn\u0092t this working??? All I need is to call my friend to trip sit me!\u0094 It wouldn\u0092t work. I could barely focus on it. \u0093My hands feel so hot, maybe something has changed electro-statically here\u0094. I was still able to think and make decisions through this. This simple task, however, wasn\u0092t happening today!\r\n\n\n\nI took what I recall as ~5 minutes and walked around the house. This felt like time I barely had. My attachment to this world was like an infant, Stumbling and wavering about.  I rid the place of evidence I had anything \u0091weird\u0092 going on. This included, picking up some lazily draped wires from the stereo I had setup for my \u0091setting\u0092. I got rid of a warm pot of water, meant to humidify the air. Finally I removed remains of the tea and molecule responsible for my current mess of a Set. I returned to the bed and attempted to address this \u0091set\u0092. I was failing to hold onto any one idea. If I did, it took everything in me to focus in on it. My last attempt was thinking that my family would find \u0093I\u0092d really screwed up. Their youngest went full idiot and killed himself with a drug\u0094. \r\n\n\n\nStaring these thoughts in the face manifested in the vision. A smoky figure rose from the wood grain in the bedroom closet door - a demonic and consuming presence of a face was rising\u0085 approaching. Behind closed eyes it re-manifested in fuller detail, \u0091calling me out\u0092 through its telepathic presence. It was like staring my behavioral personality in the face. I could see what the backdrop of cigarette butts, bad skin-tone, unsightly hair and lazy posture were saying (I didn\u0092t embody this physically speaking, however I judged myself so). It was like looking Iron Maidens mascot \u0091Eddie\u0092 in the face. Picture the 1980 self-titled album cover. It was a 1 on 1 staring contest in the same room right after Eddie finds his way to your house and fuses with bits and pieces of you - removing parts of your humanness, putting himself in your place\u0085taking over. This had a feel, much like Buddhism's \u0091mara\u0092 I later imagined. It was trying to trick me (DMT Trickster?) into thinking it ruled my ego, in a sense.\r\n\n\n\nI felt in danger. I also felt like I deserved this-Like who I was as a person, was inadequate. These emotions, the self-judgment, disappointment, hopelessness were not something I was used to dealing with, to such a soul crushing, \u0091damning\u0092 degree. What I came to find within those minutes, was I was entirely too hard on myself. These projected images, were also like emotions projected upon others. So much for handling this. My saving grace was, feeling I understood this as being a problem with so many other conscious beings. \r\n\n\n\nA bit of courage was captured in these moments. This glaring and ironic \u0091I have a trick up my own sleeve\u0092 feeling entered in. I remembered it as something that didn\u0092t seem part of my wakeful consciousness \u0085\u0091from beyond\u0092. \u0093I can still decide how to live or die, how I can \u0091be\u0092\u0094. Final moments or not, they counted. How else can I say this\u0085 I moved into \u0091the now\u0092. I played out my final moments as if part of the sufi continual-cosmic-dance, a show. I sat up in bed, in one place, and started to do some yogic movements and felt ready to kick some ass.  I\u0092m not quite sure where this confidence of \u0091welcoming\u0092 was stored, but IT WAS INSIDE THE WHOLE TIME! I told myself, \u0093just keep moving/breathing. It\u0092s ok, it\u0092s always ok. I love you.\u0094 \u0093just keep moving/breathing. It\u0092s ok, it\u0092s always ok. I love you.\u0094 \n\n\n\nI cannot fully describe or remember the timing of the following events. We are perhaps approaching the 1hr30min mark since \u0093Begin-Visuals\u0094. I can say, choosing the movement was as ungrounded as my sense of time. I mean I say that, and I just took a psychedelic. That\u0092s what happens right? Though I wouldn\u0092t change this choice, it was dangerous. I had resisted the anesthetic properties of DMT to keep me planted. Relatively speaking, I was hyper vigilant. Perhaps the effects generated by my different neurology? It could also be the restless features of the MAOI. This could be an important question. From looking at recommendations around the community, seek stillness. You can seriously hurt yourself, something I (by the grace of something) narrowly avoided.  \r\n\n\n\nThe movements sped up until I couldn't even account for them as being my own. My arms were flying about my whole body in what felt like perfect symmetry. This yoga was turning into a hyperdimensional travel centrifuge. It felt as though I was creating a \u0091field\u0092 around me, \u0091prepping my vehicle for launch\u0092. When all this was happening, one moment of \u0093what am I doing?\u0094 passed. I lost symmetry and flew off the bed in an instant. Upon doing so my movements broke a cheap brass plated handle off the dresser beside the bed and I sent a decent sized loudspeaker half way across the room. I know what it looks like, \u0093Where was the discipline? Where was the set and setting?\u0094 Look, no one has been prepared, (as far as I\u0092ve found) especially for an extended alone session with dying.  \r\n\n\n\nFinally I stopped moving. Maybe the gash on my knee and both ankles was what brought me back to physical awareness. I don\u0092t know if I would have stopped otherwise. It could\u0092ve been much worse. I just sat on the floor for a moment still \u0091interfering\u0092. The feeling was, 'now look at what you've done, you've tainted the whole experience with your clumsy shenanigans. Now what? For all you know you may be stuck in this place for good. What if your family finds you like this? What will they think? Does it matter?' Here in this place, I felt spread across everything, feeling alone. I felt infinitely small, large,  free, yet trapped. I was not completely overwhelmed yet, but in a way I had already let go. \r\n\n\n\nI could still remember I was human. I could make out that I was on the floor in my room past the visions, In and out of what looked like a digital, yet organic self-recycling 2D surface. It reminded me of red blood cellular traffic racing beside white blood cells, a hint of electrical impulses/grid like structure and the DMT language embroidering. Despite wrecking myself, I found the mental or otherwise strength to tell myself, \u0093it's ok. You\u0092re ok. Focus, get back on track.\u0094 This hope got me moving. So lets go, its time\u0085\r\n\n\n\nI barely propped myself back up on the bed and something \u0091new\u0092 happened. Closed eyes presented the brightest golden culmination/collection of beings I\u0092ve ever encountered. A review of all of the above revealed moments of understanding and compassion for myself and others who have suffered from the reflections I had just endured. This was enough. In a moments notice, this 'judge\u0094 allowed me past it/him/her/whatever. Maybe it was some level of me, I cannot remember the feeling. The transition is completely gone to me here. I can only recall the concept of pieces being \u0091restored\u0092 to the original state my consciousness was in prior to this \u0091explosion\u0092 or whatever it was. \r\n\n\n\nSome speak of a shimmering blackness. However, I can\u0092t even conceptualize that. It\u0092s as if such a label would judge it as something it isn\u0092t. It felt apparent, however, I resolved into everything. My ego was gone, any remains of concern (not to be confused with memory or awareness, these were intact) of this life had vanished. What was also interesting is, this place was bearable for only a moment. It was recursive at that \u0091Top State\u0092. I\u0092m not sure how long I was there. I got the sense that I cannot stay once I could distinguish a compartmentalized sense of self again. It was as if, something began telling me, \u0093You\u0092re not done yet\u0094, but not like that. It was non-englishable. In other words, some chance for experience and entropy to exist again was \u0091calling me back\u0092.  \r\n\n\n\nThings were being restored, it was all completely novel. I wish I could explain that, but imagine being on vacation from your body and your personality. Time isn\u0092t a thing. It could\u0092ve been 50 seconds or 50 minutes. My perception was the wholesome holographic of the entire universe\u0085 It happened. That\u0092s all my human instruction set can handle. Being in this place, I felt I was responsible. It was like all forms were kept by what I was. I could focus in on the never distant memories of being young, old, ape, fish, single point-earth worms view, you name it. The moment when I was Ape, my whole body of hair was the perfect/glistening.\r\n\n\n\nThere was something else happening with this, an unconscious count. As I went through these rounds of recursion, each brought the re-installment/refinement back to human consciousness. It was Computational; the process was without error; the vision, liquid crystal. It couldn\u0092t happen any other way. It\u0092s like I was aware of the chemical technology and its process all within me\u0085so perfect. I have never been so comfortable in my life. It's like something repaired me, worked out the kinks. Divine heat and pleasantry was at the reigns. I had handed up control, to what I knew was a more effective lead. However, it was me all along. It was all good. \r\n\n\n\nSomething else bizarre and ecstatic happened here. Yes I say this even now, as I have never known or heard of the phenomena that followed and extended to my body. Laying in the universe/bed, I started to revolve each and every muscle and limb of my body, slowly. Not in a convulsive or way of seizing. It was like the furthest entropic movements possible for all of my muscles in a gentle and slow-rhythmic fashion. From my eye brows and lips, to my toes, I was experiencing this gentle movement. My legs would sprawl slowly down the bed, then revolve up and inwards towards my core. The one leg, would land to my side and the other slowly touched down after, creating a wide gated walk, lying in place. With every perfect-circular flux my physical body made, it was reflected in the vision. \r\n\n\n\nI remember when my head would rock forward-to-back, it was as if a Mohawk was just whipped through the cosmos. That hair extended out creating infinite waves of movement. Accompanying that head movement was deeper meaning. Moving my Head-up, was a consideration of something\u0085anything, perhaps multiple things from this perspective; Head-down, acknowledgement; Head from left and right, welcoming the next thing to consider. Every point on my body was involved with the very same depth. \r\n\n\n\nAll situations, considerations and data were not problematic. At no time did the distinguishing of good/bad enter in. If I could muster some sort of emotion, it would have been a big bang of tears made of appreciation. At that time, such was my situation. What we call \u0093The Big Bang\u0094 seemed like my dance. If there\u0092s a human metaphor to this part of the experience, it is Alex Greys \u0093Cosmic Elf\u0094 art. Tied up and loving every minute of the infinite flux. \r\n\n\n\nThe removal or filtration from the experience was well under way. Maybe I am being reborn, a universe and a soul, meshing again with the physical plenum among all the other players of my\u0085this game. This thinking was a blast and allowed me to reduce the trauma associated with the first half of the climax. I considered just how I wanted the universe to form, everything from the concept-of-concept, communication, mathematics, sentience, to subjective relations. Ideas were \u0091a thing to hold onto\u0092 again. I grasped how I wanted my life to play out and others in it. It\u0092s as if a version of me put this human device precisely in place, to allow for this great charade of forgetting and remembering - A plot within a play of hide and seek. \r\n\n\n\nMy accelerating descent is when I could finally distill what happened above! I became ever more aware of the strange movements and how my brain was reaching out, gaining control and bearing in this reality again. A voice manifested out of this, perhaps my own intuition, guiding me. It said, 'it's time to try'. This was as booming and clear as the word of God. Repeatedly it would say, 'Stand... Not yet? That's ok, who cares. Stand. Not yet? That's ok, who cares.' The revolutions of my body came more into focus. Now, the complete return into the physical, a confidence, and an infinite power would prove its ability to again pilot my body. When the time was right, 'STAND!' and one final massively pronounced revolution, with what seemed like a finale to a symphony sounded in my soul. Directly after, a verbal utterance from my body\u0085 something of a sigh or breath of closure flew out. It was something of shamanic flavor \u0093Shashashashaashaaa\u0085 \u0093. I opened my eyes. \r\n\n\n\nThe next few minutes were a quick decline. For some reason during this time, another phenomenon I have heard described before happened. I thought I heard a bunch of prop-airplanes going by overhead\u0085 very strange. Everything propeller driven from helicopters to turbo props was whizzing by right outside my window. This seemed like the \u0091carrier signaling\u0092 or pieces of my consciousness restoring order in the brain. I imagined it was my humanity being buttoned up/isolated from that feeling of non-locality once again. Truly a humbling and awe inspiring experience\u0085 of which I was the awe. Not in egotistical way, but a glaring responsibility enforcing way.\r\n\n\n\nIt was 3-4AM upon reaching (what felt like though im sure wasn't) baseline consciousness. 4-5hrs had passed. I was dazed\u0085clear but dazed. 4-5hrs had passed. I was dazed\u0085clear but dazed. In shock, I was relieved and horrified by what just took place. I was still shaken to the core. It was astounding to be alive and a blessing to be worthy of being an 'individual surrounded by many' again. I was also confused, however. I wondered what I was doing back. Like, if I had really gone that far, was I really supposed to be back? What was left to do with life? I just did everything imaginable in myself\u0085with everything I perceive as outside of myself. That responsibility associated with \u0093You\u0092re God, The One, The Universe\u0094 and perhaps some artifacts of serotonin syndrome kept me up, thinking for ~3 nights, including that night. \r\n\n\n\nIt was incredibly interesting, during those following days, however equally as frightening during the night hours. I would try and sleep, but wasn't tired. If I did fall asleep, I would awaken suddenly feeling very warm. Naps during the summer day sometimes included a mini-experience, vivid waking dreams. It was by a feeling that I was on the verge of blowing up the universe, creating a black hole or imploding on myself. You could say i felt a single binary bit away from figuring something out that would produce, the aforementioned experience I just described. \r\n\n\n\nOn the 2nd night, I had taken 3mg of melatonin to see if it would have classical effects and help me sleep. I was in for a rude awakening. This had stimulated and overloaded my receptor sites, to my understanding. This was to the point where I had become feverish, anxious and had almost started convulsing or seizing. For the next 3-4 hours I would struggle to remain grounded, calm and without some degree of shakes. Fortunately I had my family by this point, ungrudgingly helping me recover. This was a powerful force to keep me attached /grounded.\r\n\nThis issue was offset by the days. At every moment I felt the best I have ever felt, physically and mentally. The very typical cold/clamminess of my fingers and toes was gone; I was on fire, you could say; Radiating so much heat and energy, never running short of good circulation; heart beat strong and slow. Moments of concern for my heart, still showed my bp was nearly perfect. I would not get hungry, but could eat at any time\u0085 I can only explain it as, I felt, God-like. Not flawed in the least, though questioning that concept through my nights. My closed eye, presented a tiny rainbow effect and either \u0091 \u221e \u0091 or the vajra symbol. Admittedly this might be the effect of what my assumptions were, spiritually at the time. It could also be a freestanding\u0096objective result of expanded consciousness. Where else in conscious experience, after all, would ancient cultures have procured these symbols?\r\n\n\n\nAfter a while, it's like I simply wanted sleep back, for the sake of the practice and the need for a peaceful unconscious state. It is strange to say this, but \u0093I took sleep back\u0094. I had decided that sleep was useful once again. Or perhaps, I was that in tune with my body\u0092s desire for sleep, finally. The 3rd night included a peaceful meditation and a falling to sleep pretty naturally. All that was left was some of the psychological paradoxes laid forth by the experience.\r\n\nPlaying with brain chemistry is typically frowned upon by \u0091the players\u0092 in this life/game but every experience and feeling I had leading up to and including this, tells me it was worth it and equivalent to what some would call \u0091sacred\u0092. This term, one that reveres and reserves the experience for religious and spiritual folk seems due to fear. I believe \u0091sacred\u0092 should be approached \u0091with light heart\u0092 for these experiences. When we push away our birth right for experience, we are automatically making judgment, even if only to ourselves. This is damaging to the psyche from my experience. \r\n\n\n\nDMT, flavored by Syrian Rue seeds was the ultimate convincer for me, as Terence McKenna has put it. I now have at least an idea of my core consciousness (maybe), who I may be and what all of this really is. We shall see. I have always believed in a creative force, but resolving up into the entirety of or becoming that force is something that makes me like \u0091O_o\u0092. The most comforting thought, after having experienced this is helping others through these experiences, thoughts and the dilemmas that arise. So is the purpose of this account. -Cheers"

        "report_text": "Der Blick des sterbenden Schneemanns in die Sonne\r\n\n\n\nDosierung: 3 Gramm gemahlene Steppenrautesamen. \r\n\n40 Minuten sp\u00e4ter: 320 mg br\u00e4unlich kristallines DMT oral in einer Gelantinekapsel\r\n\n\n\nVorgeschichte: \r\n\nIch habe seit ca 10 Jahren recht viel Erfahrung gesammelt mit Psycholytischen Substanzen, die durchweg sehr gute Qualit\u00e4t hatten: LSD, MDMA, Methylon, DMT, Mescalin, und Pilze.\r\n\nMeistens bin ich in professionell und freundschaftlich geleiteten Settings gereist, \u00f6fters aber auch schon alleine. \r\n\n\n\nBisher habe ich DMT zweimal oral eingenommen und schon mehrmals geraucht. Die meisten Erfahrungen mit DMT waren \u00e4usserst beeindruckend, und haben mich neugierig gemacht auf das gewaltige Potential dieses Stoffes. Die Lekt\u00fcre des Buches von Strassmann \u0084DMT\u0093 hat mich zus\u00e4tzlich darin best\u00e4rkt, weiterhin mit DMT zu experimentieren.\r\n\n\n\nNun zur Reise:\r\n\nzehn vor elf Vormittags: Ich weiss, dass ich f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chsten 10 Stunden alleine im Haus sein werde. Ich nehme den sorgsam zubereiteten Sud zu mir:\u0096 einen Auszug aus 3 Gramm Steppenraute. Mit einer Pfefferm\u00fchle habe ich am Tag zuvor die Samen dieser W\u00fcstenpflanze zu einem sehr feinen Pulver zerrieben und dann mit dem Saft einer Limone und etwa ebensoviel Wasser ca. anderthalb Stunden gekocht. Ein Teefilter aus Papier diente dazu, die gr\u00f6beren Bestandteile am Ende herauszufiltern. \u00dcbrig blieb ein gelblich gr\u00fcner, nicht sonderlich appetitlich aussehender Saft, der ein halbes Trinkglas f\u00fcllt. Ich trinke ihn. Es gibt sicherlich schmackhafteres. Aber da ich weiss, dass es f\u00fcr einen guten Zweck ist, macht es mir relativ wenig M\u00fche. Die Spannung und Vorfreude \u00fcberwiegt, zumal mich die pflanzlichen Wirkstoffe zunehmend mehr reizen. \r\n\n\n\nEin sachkundiger Bekannter hat mir geraten, dass ich mit der Einnahme des DMT warte, bis die leicht sedierende Wirkung des Harmalins eingesetzt hat, um sicher zu gehen, dass das sp\u00e4ter oral zu mir genommene DMT auch wirken kann. Vierzig Minuten sp\u00e4ter \u0096 um halb zw\u00f6lf vormittags - beschlie\u00dfe ich, die von mir selbst gef\u00fcllte Kapsel mit sorgsam abgewogenen 320 mg br\u00e4unlichem DMT zu mir zu nehmen \u0096 obwohl ich zu diesem Zeitpunkt eigentlich keine Wirkung der Steppenraute sp\u00fcren kann. Ich halte f\u00fcr m\u00f6glich, dass das ganze Experiment ein Flop wird. Ich halte f\u00fcr m\u00f6glich, dass das ganze Experiment ein Flop wird. \n\n\n\nNach ca 25 Minuten setzt eine erste deutliche visuelle Wirkung des DMTs ein. Geometrische Muster \u00fcberlagern meine optische Wahrnehmung des Raumes, in dem ich mich befinde. Obwohl ich mich freue, dass es offensichtlich gelungen ist, die entsprechenden Enzyme (MAO) mit Hilfe des Harmalins der  Steppenraute daran zu hindern, das DMT abzubauen, finde ich die geometrischen Muster nicht sonderlich spannend. Sie ber\u00fchren mich nicht, haben keine Bedeutung f\u00fcr mich. Kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter baut sich in mir eine weiche, wohlwollende Energie auf \u0096 die Reise, von der ich noch nicht weiss, wo sie mich hinf\u00fchren wird, scheint unter einem guten Stern zu stehen. Dann flacht bald die Wirkung wieder ab und ich frage mich leicht entt\u00e4uscht, ob es das schon war. Einem verr\u00fcckten Impuls meiner Gier, doch noch ein Gramm Pilze zu nehmen, widerstehe ich entschieden, es ist nur ein Gedanke mit keinerlei Willenskraft, nur ein Gedankenspiel mit einer M\u00f6glichkeit, der ich angesichts dessen, was dann sp\u00e4ter noch kommt, Gott sei Dank widerstehe. \r\n\n\n\nZu gut weiss ich, dass das DMT in Wellen kommt und in seinem Verlauf f\u00fcr mich unberechenbar ist. Ich warte also weiter ab. Sodbrennen stellt sich ein \u0096 sicherlich eine Folge des DMTs in meinem Magen. Kurz frage ich mich, ob die Kapsel vielleicht in meiner Speiser\u00f6hre stecken geblieben ist und sich dort aufgel\u00f6st hat. Ich trinke etwas \u0096 warte weiterhin ab. Es dauert nicht lange und es beginnt mich eine untergr\u00fcndige Furcht zu beschleichen. Eines ist gewiss: Es geht mir zunehmend schlechter, Angst und Unruhe bef\u00e4llt mich, ich muss mich \u00fcbergeben, immer \u00f6fter, versuche wieder zu mir zu finden, f\u00fchle mich zunehmend \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigt von einer Kraft, die st\u00e4rker ist als ich, die mich in die Zange nimmt, mich ihr gnadenlos unterwirft, meinen K\u00f6rper in Aufruhr versetzt, mich immer \u00f6fter \u00fcbergeben l\u00e4sst. \r\n\n\n\nZum Gl\u00fcck habe ich in weiser Voraussicht eine entsprechende Schale f\u00fcr diesen Fall bereitgestellt. In meiner Not gestehe ich ein: \u0084Ja, ich sehe es sein \u0096 ich will nicht eingestehen, dass es etwas Gr\u00f6sseres gibt als mich, dem ich mich hingeben muss, etwas viel Gewaltigeres als ich, etwas, das ich anerkennen muss als eine Kraft, die \u00fcber mir steht, der ich ausgeliefert bin, \u00e4hnlich dem Schneemann, der in die Sonne blickt, gen\u00fcgend Bewusstseinskraft hat, sie wahrzunehmen aber keinerlei Chance, sich ihrer schmelzenden Kraft zu entziehen. Das was er sieht, wird zweifelsohne seine Form, seine Identit\u00e4t zum Schmelzen bringen. In meiner Not erkl\u00e4re ich mich bereit, zu sterben, lege mich hin, wie ich es im Umgang mit psychedelischen Substanzen gelernt habe, um wieder Stille zu finden. Aber die anbrandende Kraft ist einfach zu stark \u0096 macht mir zuviel Angst, ich habe Angst zu sterben, leide immer mehr, f\u00fchle mich irgendwann nur noch in den Schlamm einer leidvollen Existenz gepresst, gezwungen, zu sterben, meine Identit\u00e4t f\u00fcr immer aufzugeben, mich zu verlieren \u0096 Panik erfasst mich, dass ich mich f\u00fcr immer verlieren k\u00f6nnte, mich nie mehr wieder finden werde. Ich gerate in einen seltsamen energetischen Raum, in dem nur noch flie\u00dfende Energien sich formieren, st\u00e4ndig ineinander \u00fcbergehen, fremdartige Energien, eine fremde Welt, f\u00fcr die ich noch nicht reif bin, so f\u00fchlt es sich an. \r\n\n\n\nDann beginne ich auf einen Punkt zuzusteuern. Das Gef\u00fchl ist: wenn ich in diesen Punkt eintauche, wird es mich zerreissen \u0096 entweder werde ich erleuchtet oder wahnsinnig. Dieser Punkt erscheint mir wie das Zentrum des Bewusstseins, allen Seins, am ehesten l\u00e4sst sich die Verr\u00fccktheit mit dem Effekt andeuten, den man auf einem Bildschirm erzeugen kann, wenn eine Video-Kamera sich auf den Bildschirm richtet, den sie mit ihren Bildern speist: Es entsteht eine selbstbez\u00fcgliche Schleife, die in die Unendlichkeit zu weisen scheint. Nur dass jetzt mein eigenes Bewusstsein mit sich selbst kurzgeschlossen wird. Ich ahne, dass ich mich dem hingeben sollte, aber die Angst vor dem Wahnsinn ist viel zu gross \u0096 Todesangst. TodesANGST. TODESANGST.  Pl\u00f6tzlich befinde ich mich in absoluter Leere. Nichts. Einfach nichts. Ich bin nicht mehr ich, sondern nur noch ein erstaunter identit\u00e4tsloser Bewusstseinspunkt, Erstaunen \u00fcber die absolute formlose Leere. Nichts. Einfach Nichts.\r\n\n\n\nDann sehe ich ein hyperintelligentes Wesen \u0096 wie ein vielarmiger Elephant aus der indischen Mythologie \u0096 das sich \u00fcber unsere Welt beugt, die es gerade erschafft. Der Sch\u00f6pfer unserer Welt. Dann wieder unendliches k\u00f6rperliches, nein eher seelisches Leid. Ich habe keine k\u00f6rperlichen Schmerzen, aber leiden tue ich trotzdem unendlich. Ich winde mich im Kampf um mein Leben. Nein! Ich will nicht sterben! Ich bin doch so froh am Leben zu sein! Ich schreie innerlich um Hilfe. Immer wieder. Dieses Leid erscheint mir wie eine tiefere Wirklichkeit, f\u00fchlt sich realer an als meine normale Alltagswirklichkeit \u0096 als ob meine bisher erlebte Normalit\u00e4t nur illusion\u00e4rer Zuckerguss \u00fcber dem eigentlichen Schrecken des Daseins war. Ein Zuckerguss, der jetzt ein f\u00fcr alle mal durch das DMT zerst\u00f6rt ist. Mein Panzer der Selbstgen\u00fcgsamkeit, mein Bollwerk gegen mein existentielles Zittern ist in tausend St\u00fccke gesprengt. Ich bin nur noch innerlich wimmerndes Elend. \r\n\n\n\nNach einer weiteren Attacke des Erbrechens entsteht in mir der Wunsch zu duschen. Ich nutze eine Phase, in der ich mich kurzzeitig wieder einiger ma\u00dfen auf den Beinen halten kann, und begebe mich von unserem Dachstock hinunter ins Badezimmer. Ich wundere mich im nachhinein, dass ich in meinem zustand die steile Treppe nicht hinab gest\u00fcrzt bin. Ich schaffe es mit staksigen Schritten noch zur Dusche. Dieser Ort wird f\u00fcr mich die Sterbekammer. Ich verliere teilweise komplett die Orientierung, setze das halbe Badezimmer unter Wasser, weil das Wasser nicht mehr so schnell abfliesst, wie ich es laufen lasse. Ich trinke aus dem Duschkopf, friere sofort, wenn ich nicht warmes Wasser \u00fcber mich fliessen lasse, Irgendwann stelle ich mit Schreck fest, dass sich das Wasser bereits bis in unseren Gang ausgebreitet hat. M\u00fchsam schalte ich das Wasser ab, k\u00e4mpfe um Koordination, breche wieder zusammen, beginne wieder zu frieren, habe wieder Durst \u0096 stelle das Wasser wieder an. Ich verliere komplett die Kontrolle \u00fcber mich.  Mein Zustand wird immer schlimmer, immer bedrohlicher. Das Sterben geht weiter. Dann h\u00f6rt mein Magen gar nicht mehr auf sich zu heben und zu senken. Es ist wie atmen, nur dass mein Magen statt Luft Wasser in sich aufnimmt um es dann wieder fast unverkrampft von sich zu geben. \r\n\n\n\nIm nachhinein w\u00fcrde ich sagen, dass ich zu diesem Zeitpunkt einen fast komplett widerstandslosen ergebenen v\u00f6llig aufgeweichten Zustand erreicht hatte, an dem sich ein Hauch von entspannter Gl\u00fcckseligkeit in mein Bewusstsein verirrte. Doch dann ging der H\u00f6llenritt weiter. Pl\u00f6tzlich d\u00e4mmert mir, nein trifft mich schliesslich die Erkenntnis wie ein Blitzschlag, dass ich heute zu weit gegangen bin, dass ich jetzt sterbe. Mehrfach trifft mich dieser Erkenntnisschock, dass ich gerade dabei bin zu sterben. Oder zumindest, dass ich tats\u00e4chlich Schaden genommen habe. Ich bin jetzt \u00fcberzeugt, dass ich f\u00fcr immer den in mir zerst\u00f6rt habe, der ich war, dass man mich finden wird, entweder tot oder v\u00f6llig durchgeknallt, alle neuronalen Schaltkreise in meinem Gehirn unwiederbringlich durchgegl\u00fcht und ich werde den Rest meines Lebens mit einer schrecklichen Bewusstseinsw\u00fcste in meinem Kopf in der Psychiatrie mein Dasein fristen m\u00fcssen, unf\u00e4hig, zu erkl\u00e4ren, was geschehen ist, nur noch gen\u00fcgend Bewusstsein, um zu leiden, aber mehr auch nicht. Ein bedauerlicher Pflegefall. Man wird rekonstruieren m\u00fcssen, was geschehen ist. Ich habe ANGST, ANGST, ANGST. Ich kann mich nicht bewegen, kann nicht f\u00fcr mich sorgen, friere, decke mich  mit nassen kalten T\u00fcchern m\u00fchsam zu, sauge Wasser aus den T\u00fcchern, weil ich Durst habe. \r\n\n\n\nSchliesslich begreife ich: ich muss dringend Hilfe holen. Ich schleppe mich zum Telefon, rufe eine Freundin an, die leider nicht zu Hause ist, spreche ihr m\u00fchsam mit Grabesstimme auf Anrufbeantworter, dass ich dringend Hilfe ben\u00f6tige. Dann stelle ich kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter das Wunder fest: die Wirkung l\u00e4sst nach. stelle ich kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter das Wunder fest: die Wirkung l\u00e4sst nach. Etwas, das ich nicht mehr f\u00fcr m\u00f6glich gehalten h\u00e4tte. Es ist jetzt vier Uhr nachmittags. Ich rufe noch mal an, spreche ein zweites Mal auf Anrufbeantworter und gebe Entwarnung. Kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter taucht sie auf und k\u00fcmmert sich um mich.\r\n\n\n\nSp\u00e4ter  kommt die erlebte Furcht in Wellen wieder, auch Tage sp\u00e4ter noch, untergr\u00fcndiger, nicht mehr so stark. Bei der ersten Welle f\u00fchle ich die Angst eines Astronauten, der zulange im Universum war, dort seine Menschlichkeit zu sehr verloren hat und dessen Schwerkraft nun nicht mehr ausreicht, um zur Erde, dieser einzigen Insel im unendlich fremdartigen und kalten Universum, zur\u00fcckzuschweben. Er hat genug Bewusstsein, um zu erkennen, was ihm geschieht, aber keinerlei Kraft und M\u00f6glichkeit, sein eigenes Davon schweben und Verloren gehen im Weltraum zu verhindern. Einmal, zwei Tage sp\u00e4ter beim Joggen, ist mir, als tauchten zwei dinosaurierartige Echsen aus dem Wald auf, die mich be\u00e4ugen. Es ist eher eine lebhafte Phantasie, keine Halluzination, aber doch deutlich von DMT-Qualit\u00e4t. Ich bewege mich noch ein paar Wochen mit meinem Bewusstsein immer mal wieder sehr nah an der Grenze zu dieser unheimlichen Welt. Erstaunlicherweise bin ich trotz allem arbeitsf\u00e4hig, war allerdings froh, die Woche unmittelbar nach der Erfahrung am Wochenende etwas frei gehalten zu haben.\r\n\n\n\nR\u00fcckblickend war es der reine Wahnsinn, diese gewaltige Reise alleine ohne Sitter zu unternehmen. Zu meiner \u0084Entlastung\u0093 muss ich sagen, dass ich solch eine Dimension der Bewusstseins-Sprengung noch nie erlebt habe \u0096 selbst meine Erfahrung mit 600 mikrogramm LSD (mit Sitter) waren ein gem\u00fctlicher Waldspaziergang dagegen. Mir ist noch mal klar geworden, wie sehr es bei DMT auch auf das richtige Timing und die Qualit\u00e4t des Harmalins ankommt. Mehrfach wurde mir w\u00e4hrend der Vorbereitung der Reise versichert, dass 320 mg DMT eine gute Dosis sei und genau jene, mit der ich schon in einem Gruppensetting sehr gute Erfahrung gemacht hatte. Ich hatte f\u00fcr meinen hier beschriebenen Selbstversuch genau den selben Stoff aus der selben Quelle genommen. Allerdings verwendete ich ein anderes Harmalin, das offensichtlich extrem potent war. Ein weiteres Experiment mit DMT werde ich nur mit einem Sitter durchf\u00fchren und allenfalls die H\u00e4lfte, wenn nicht sogar ein Drittel der DMT-Menge nehmen, also zwischen 100-160mg DMT.\r\n\nEiner der positiven Effekte war, dass ich durch dieses Erlebnis auf unglaubliche Weise mit einer erbarmungslosen Wucht in die Demut katapultiert wurde. Seit dem habe ich mehr Mitgef\u00fchl mit leidenden Lebewesen. Ein weitere positive, wenn auch sehr harte Lektion war die Erkenntnis, dass es eine unermesslich gr\u00f6ssere Kraft  gibt als mich. \r\n\n\n\nEin paar Monate lang hatte ich seit dieser Erfahrung Angst vor dem Tod, die mir fr\u00fcher fremd war, weil ich seit der Reise die Bef\u00fcrchtung hatte, dass ich dann wieder - und zwar dann ohne R\u00fcckfahrschein - in diesen Raum unendlichen Leidens und Wahnsinns geraten werde. Vor kurzem machte es pl\u00f6tzlich \u0084Klick\u0093 und ich begriff, dass ich ja auch von daher komme, dort war, bevor ich geboren wurde, mich jetzt eine Weile auf dieser Insel der Menschlichkeit aufhalten darf, bevor ich wieder gehen muss, d. h. dass diese unermesslich grosse Macht mich ja offensichtlich auch hierher gebracht hat, mir also auch wohl gesonnen ist und nicht nur so schrecklich, wie ich sie w\u00e4hrend der Reise erlebt habe."

        "report_text": "-First Journey-\r\n\n\n\nMethod: Glass Vapor Genie\r\n\nAmount: Approximately 10mg or so vaporized\r\n\nSet and Setting: Comfortable well meditated head space, in my meditation room\r\n\nNotes: Audio of trip recorded. 1 other present, spouse\r\n\nDescription: Fear Abolishing Comforting Reassurance\r\n\n\n\nI began by setting up two vapor discs. We loaded 55 mg onto each of them as we knew we would not be finishing it in a go (two of us using the same discs, my partner and I) and wanted to allow ourselves some comfort room. I am very comfortable with vaporization. I use extract vaporization as a primary means of cannabis use, and am more than comfortable with my technique. I let the torch meet the element and began to get a nice thick vapor. On this first foray into the unknown I allowed myself only one smallish thick hit and held it for approximately 10 seconds.\r\n\n\n\nI did not hear a sound, it was more as if I felt an oncoming vibration. The sensation grew in waves and I laid back and closed my eyes. It was as if the spice was showing me that it meant me no ill will. The experience culminated in beautiful CEVs and an overwhelming sense of comfort. Much like that feeling of deja-vu where when I meet someone I feel as if they are an old friend I am meeting once more.\r\n\n\n\nFor about 5 minutes beautiful mandalas of light danced with geometric frameworks that shifted and changed forms and a distinctly male figure echoed across the entirety of it as though they were watching me through the mandala wall. I felt overwhelmingly loved and reassured and vocalized this.\r\n\n\n\nUpon re-entry to normal headspace I found all doubts and discomforts lifted from me and was truly ready to begin my work with the sacred spice.\r\n\n\n\n-Second Journey-\r\n\n\n\nMethod: Glass Vapor Genie\r\n\nAmount: Approximately 15-20mg or so vaporized\r\n\nSet and Setting: 1 hour and 30 minutes after first journey, after another round of meditation, in my meditation room.\r\n\nNotes: Audio of trip recorded, 1 other present, spouse\r\n\nDescription: First Encounter, One foot in, One foot out. Shown my first steps.\r\n\n\n\nWe began by changing discs, as we had each (my partner and I alternated) vaporized approximately 10mg or so off the first disc and did not want to run it dry. With a fresh disc loaded I sat down and calmed any pre-flight anxiety. This time I allowed myself two hits both held for 10seconds, both medium and comprised of thick vaporous smoke.\r\n\n\n\nBy the time I was inhaling the second the vibration was already growing in frequency and amplitude. My partner asked if I wanted a third and I declined and laid back.\r\n\n\n\nThis time the mandala wall was swiftly upon me and I felt as though I popped through it and into another locale where geometry was pristine, divine and in some cases downright impossible to comprehend. The colors were less kaleidoscopic and more hyper-real. However everything was fuzzy and I could not clearly make out my surroundings for about 3 to 5 seconds. It was then that I became aware that I was in a seated, almost crumpled position in front of someone who was sitting at a console looking over various readings. Suddenly he became aware of me and he rose to greet me.\r\n\n\n\nI felt more than heard his words and speaking to him thusly was very natural to me at this point. He greeted me and told me his name. L\u00e6ohah, after I mispronounced it a few times he explained that the symbolism of the \u00e6 character was important to his name. That Laohah, Leohah. and indeed even Laeohah were incorrect. I apologized and he sighed and assured me he was more than patient with me, he had been waiting to be my guide on this journey for some time and was simply wondering when I would arrive. He then chuckled and told me I had now thought about breathing 3 times and that because of it I was only halfway through the door.\r\n\n\n\nTo my astonishment I replied, very vocally, 'I did, you are right, now that is rude of me.'\r\n\n\n\nChuckling he said, 'Yes it IS rude of you. But that is not something we have to work on, in the future just do not worry about your flesh, it will be fine.' This was the most vocal part of our conversation, and the part most associated with words. After that he indicated I should pay attention to what he was going to show me. He tapped my abdomen and my Svadhisthana Chakra appeared in a three dimensional window but it was damaged.\r\n\n\n\nHe told me that though I had awakened my Kundalini it was travelling a rough road due to things I was holding on to from my past that were affecting my sexual chakra. He asked me if the molestation that I had endured earlier in life had affected my sexuality in a negative way and caused me to seek some unhealthy aspects of sexuality. I admitted this was indeed the case. That sexual molestation had left me, for lack of a better word, kinky.\r\n\n\n\nHe informed that this would be the topic of my next journey, and that dealing with it would be rough. But that it needed to happen for me to more completely understand the work I need to do on that side.\r\n\n\n\nHe told me it was now time for me to go, to my embarrassment I sort of threw a divine tantrum. I waved my arms about and told him I did not want to go. With a smile he assured me that I would never want to leave but that my flesh, my life and indeed my place in the world would not sort themselves out in my absence and assured me that I would return again countless times in life and again in death.\r\n\n\n\nI opened my eyes. A profound sense of peace washed over me. I cried. I smiled. I laughed and most importantly I felt truly alive. Kundalini energy washed over me in waves such as I had not ever felt and I simply enjoyed the feeling for the next twenty minutes.\r\n\n\n\n-Third Journey-\r\n\n\n\nMethod: Glass Vapor Genie\r\n\nAmount: Approximately 20-25mg or so Vaporized\r\n\nSet and Setting: After an hour meditation, in my meditation room\r\n\nNotes: Audio of trip recorded, 1 other present, spouse\r\n\nDescription: Svadhisthana cleansed, cosmic classroom under the great owl, purging, speaking in tongues, open eye breakthrough\r\n\n\n\nThough this was by far my most profound experience to date I can only say that it is also my most recent and has truly lefty me with less words for it than the others. As L\u00e6ohah had warned me, it was rough.\r\n\n\n\nI will never be able to be convinced open eyed breakthroughs are not possible, my partner says I was open eyed the whole time, and was rather 'movey' but I was not here at all, in any way, I had no body.\r\n\n\n\nI took a very large hit, maybe an 18 second pull of constantly roiling vapor, (big lungs) a good 20ish plus milligrams on the disc I had loaded with 38mg (that first disc we both only took one light hit of) went down. I did not even have a micro second to think. The mandala wall slammed into me at a million miles an hour. I had no time to lay down, close my eyes, not even a second to think about not doing these things. Apparently I fell backwards pretty easily.\r\n\n\n\nThe next part is hard to describe so bear with me.\r\n\n\n\nImpossible ever changing geometry everywhere, two large streams of consciousness flowing towards a single point and I hit that point hard. I am in class. Cosmic class, learning about soul choice and soul contracts. Great owl is teaching it, his eyes are galactic bodies, his patience infinite.\r\n\n\n\nEveryone stops.\r\n\n\n\nThey are aware that me, now me, has come to the classroom. I came bearing something I was not supposed to. A hand appears. And it points to my third eye and tells me to listen. It tells me they know I am visiting but that the unpleasantry I am carrying is unwelcome even by my own soul in this place. I am asked if I am ready to let it go.\r\n\n\n\nI start talking in a language I know as the language of souls, or at least the language they are speaking in this place. I answer their question and tell them I am ready to let it go. (I was actually talking aloud and have it recorded)\r\n\n\n\n'SPIT IT OUT,' Owl says. In class I spit out an orange green glob that begins to unfurl. Physically, I purge. Apparently I turned right to the purge bucket.\r\n\n\n\n'Look at it and tell me what you see,' Owl says.\r\n\n\n\nThe orange green glob blossoms into the sickened Svadhisthana I had been carrying and I feel my Chakra regenerate healthily (incidentally I came out of it and my kinks are gone, replaced with a passionate healthy desire for non kinky sex with my partner). I describe this to him, the entirety of it in that same language. (still talking aloud, to my puke apparently while waving my hand over it) And the class claps. Owl then explains that I signed up for this it is a part of my soul's journey that I came back to cleanse that here then and tells me to go after his lesson.\r\n\n\n\nAfter the lesson about soul contracts is over, I thank him and explain that it has been a great pleasure, then I casually begin to walk back to reality. (now turned back to the direction I was first talking in and still talking aloud) Here is where I realize I had an open eyed breakthrough. Reality breaks through bit by bit and I start to see things in the room coming into hyperspace. Including my spouse who I once again saw with her furry caterpillar soul face. That I have seen before.\r\n\n\n\nIt was magnificent.\r\n\n\n\nI am still digesting.\r\n\n\n\nMost intensely visual, visceral psychedelic experience I have ever had and I know it was just the tip of the iceberg.\r\n\n\n\n-Fourth through Seventh Journeys-\r\n\n\n\nDisclaimer, what you are about to read is long and personally spiritual.\r\n\n\n\nNamaste,\r\n\n\n\nI find it hard to begin articulation of my last forays into the outer realms of hyperspace. But one thing is certain. I have found linearity in Hyperspace with an ever unfolding journey, each one building upon the last, and the same beings recurring at times with new ones appearing as needed. A proverbial hero's journey into the outer realms. My journey.\r\n\n\n\nMuch like is experienced with Ayahuasca, Mescaline and other Entheogens I am faced with my own turmoil, human flaws and errors and expected to come out victorious if I want to learn more of what 'they' have to teach. They being my various guides and the beings I have thus far met. The spirits and higher frequency beings, alien and familiar. And the lessons learned have been so very, very deep and have brought me closer to both nature and to myself, they have freed me from demons that have long plagued me and they have caused paradigm shifts unlike any other entheogen I have here-to-fore experienced.\r\n\n\n\nMy last postPreviously I summed up my first three experiences, culminating in the cleansing of one of my chakras that had grown sickly. It can be read in the post above. What has happened since then has been nothing short of miraculous in my life and has been completely transformative.\r\n\n\n\nFirst let me note one phenomenon that was present the entire time I would visit this school. As I enter it a stream of imagery, symbols and knowledge pours into my left eye. While the scene plays out in my right. My fourth journey began much like my others, with intent to hear what I needed or to see whatever the sacred spice wished to show me. This is vocalized in a ritualistic fashion as I load the spice. The room was cleansed, the singing bowl sung, and I sat down to begin. Two extremely large inhalations brought a full 30mg of medicine into me. And it began. Streams of energy and symbols flow into me and I'm through.\r\n\n\n\nI was again back in the preparatory school where my previous journey had taken place. Only this time the being set to teach me was a hyper-dimensional being that existed as many beings in one room. It was very active with many arms and forms both invisible and visible as well as light ray limbs and sound based tools. Yet all were one within its room, the only beings in there save it were myself and L\u00e6ohah. It was very intense. And could easily be seen as frightening in its intensity, yet I had no fear.\r\n\n\n\nIt probed me and prodded me and declared me worthy. Of what I did not know. It informed me that what I had begun would begin that which could not be undone if I continued beyond its lesson. But that its lesson was the last step to me choosing if this was the road I wanted. It was not speaking about my use of spice but about how I would forevermore interact with those realms. It assured me I did not have to choose just yet. It asked if I was prepared for this lesson and gift.\r\n\n\n\nI said yes.\r\n\n\n\nMy soul was laid bare. Energy poured through me like nothing I had felt before that moment. From Muladhara energy poured into me and I saw the beings with whom I used to astral journey as well as many of the choices I have made, both good and ill that weighed on my soul or lifted it. As the flow of energy continued to pulse through me I felt it move through my newly cleansed Svahisthana and light it up swelling it to normal proportions. What happened next was intense, and apparently my back arched as I wanted to wail and I inhaled sharply according to my partner. But it was not pain, it was pure intensity.\r\n\n\n\nPOP.\r\n\n\n\nFrom Svadhisthana it shot through Manipura, Anahata and Visshudha like lightning. So many choices that affected these areas laid before me. And many of the ill choices lasting effects were expelled in that wave. It was like fire had flown into me and lit me up. I was alive. And then it began to work. So many arms and other things flitting into my body changing things. Priming energy points and testing them conferring with itself to assure it was doing everything that needed to be done with me. Along with this came the lesson. I was worthy. I had been chosen. But to know what I had been chosen for I had to choose based on this intensity alone. This pleasure and pain, this facing of my innermost demons and doubts.\r\n\n\n\nI accepted. The two streams of energy information that pour into my left eye become four. I was told that my next journey would be at night when the sun was nowhere to be seen, I was also told to be ready, for the next stage could not be undone and would leave me changed forever more. What I would see could not be unseen. And all would be laid bare then.\r\n\n\n\nAs I came back to my body I lay there and I cried with ecstasy and joy. Sorrow for my misdeeds and humility for what I had been taught. And that was only the next stage in my preparation. I had not yet been turned loose into the realms nor even met any of my guides beyond L\u00e6ohah and yet I felt assured and at home. Like I had finally heard a voice that had been calling to me for ages I felt assured and at home. Like I had finally heard a voice that had been calling to me for ages, one I had ignored somehow for far too long.\r\n\n\n\nMy next journey would be 2 days later at around 11pm, after complete dark, in complete dark, as I was told. Night had fallen, my house was darkened. I loaded the spice in silence with only a crystal lamp as a light source. I was humble and asked to learn what needed to be learned see what needed to be seen.\r\n\n\n\n2 large inhalations, 35mg of medicine.\r\n\n\n\nMy fifth journey begins. Black Fractals came flowing to me and washed over me, they were the most beautiful black on black on black fractals with silver, blue and green highlights and glowing symbols in them. Very much akin to the Secret Writing done by Allyson Grey. Through them I went and back to the preparatory school. A dark room with impossible geometry floating about it. A silver blue and green circle sits in the center of the floor. I stepped into it instinctively. I sense the presence of an entity but I cannot see it. It begins to speak to me. Four flows begin into my eye, doubling each time we spoke after the first.\r\n\n\n\nDo you accept?\r\n\n\n\nI accept. (Four)\r\n\n\n\nDo you accept knowing you cannot undo what is done this night?\r\n\n\n\nI accept. (Eight)\r\n\n\n\nDo you accept knowing you will have to know me?\r\n\n\n\nI accept. (Sixteen)\r\n\n\n\nThe sixteen streams become one, and we meet. Also note I was saying this aloud, 'I accept' 3 times.\r\n\n\n\nDeath, sweat death unfolded before my eyes. Laid bare, and showed me the truth of my old self. With a gentle hand, she touched my brow and I felt my third eye open. Light pouring out of it. I could see her face, and she could see me. I knew then I would never again fear her, how could I. Caressing my face, she told me that it was done, my eye was open and the old me had passed in many ways but was not yet ready to fully die and be reborn. But that the process had begun and she would claim the old me at my rebirth and would see me again then.\r\n\n\n\nThe teacher left and I was left with assistants. They played with my eye and showed me how to use it. They tested it and played optical illusions forcing me to see them with it. And once they were satisfied it was not going to close they bid me until next time. They told me I was done and could now begin my journey, but to note how things interacted with me as it would be different than if I were not on this path and that my crown would open at my rebirth.\r\n\n\n\nLaying there eyes weeping, I simply said over and over again, 'I saw death and I accepted. I am to be reborn. I accepted.' it was one of the most beautiful things of my life. But what occurred after is what really astounds me. Words do not do justice what it feels like to have your eye open. What it feels like to again hear the call of the spirits and the voice of nature after having let life teach you to drown it out.\r\n\n\n\nI also knew I no longer needed the 'primer streams' as I and hyperspace had attenuated to one another.\r\n\n\n\nThat night my partner also had a huge integration needed breakthrough and it would be the next day that I would again utilize the sacred spice, but not to journey, instead as sacred medicine.\r\n\n\n\nHuge shifts bring huge change which brings new reactions to old things. Old stresses I used to deal with in an unhealthy manner now demand my attention in ways that I had not expected and the next day the same was also true of my partner.\r\n\n\n\nUH-OH!\r\n\n\n\nWe had a discord moment and an emotional fight ensued. In order to not feed the chaos I felt the call of the spice. I moved upstairs with alacrity and partook of one small inhalation eyes wide open. The spice had called me and told me it would let me see the problem in a calm manner and find a solution and it did just that. The world calmed around me. I went downstairs and defused the situation and allowed us the days of integration we needed without the chaos of discord.\r\n\n\n\n2 days of integration passed and things in life started to take on a new light. My spouse and I began to plan our life changes that would enable us to live the way we need spiritually while still maintaining the 'Even the Buddha does the dishes' attitude and began to plan a spiritual retreat into the wilderness for late this summer.\r\n\n\n\nCrystal intent. My next journey was rough. Meant to be. I felt called to partake without any ritual whatsoever. 25mg broke me through.\r\n\n\n\nSixth Journey Begins. Back to school. Chaos in the classroom.\r\n\n\n\nWhat was done cannot be undone.\r\n\n\n\nI must have crystal intent.\r\n\n\n\nThat was the entirety of that breakthrough.\r\n\n\n\n1 full day of integration later, I crystallized my intent. To allow the spice to show me what came next, and perhaps to meet some of my teachers should they be ready to reveal themselves. \r\n\n\n\nMy seventh journey began with a lesson shared with my spouse about singing bowls. She liked to ding the bowl then sing it. This produces a very subtly yet notably different tone than gently singing it to volume. I showed this to her. My intent was crystal and I had chosen to use one of our large crystal clear pieces of spice.\r\n\n\n\n23mg was all it took. 1 small hit to begin and I could feel it coming on strong, a second and that was all it took. I did not once lay back, the entire trip occurred in lotus position before my singing bowl.\r\n\n\n\nThis one was....WOW. Again it was also proof that I open eyed breakthrough as much as I close eyed breakthrough, nothing I did with my physical body brought me out of the lesson.\r\n\n\n\nOkay so bear with me on this one as it is still very fresh and will seem a bit less cohered in how I can relate it. I have been allowed now into Hyperspace. The last step was truly the last step in the school. I could see it behind me. A shining building of light. Owl was atop it watching me, a smile in his galactic eyes.\r\n\n\n\nI turned to face the path ahead. Streams of jewel colored impossible geometry and energy flowed out before me in multiple colors and I began to float or fly up the stream. Strange beings are everywhere, some watch on serenely, vaguely humanoid in body they have heads of pure light and they are pleased to see I made it. Small elves dance and appear popping into and out of existence, using the fractals in the air around me as mirror doors to do so.\r\n\n\n\nL\u00e6ohah suddenly stands before me. 'It is time to face it,' he sternly tells me. I know what he means instinctively and I know what to do.\r\n\n\n\nAll the beings watching on are excited to see how things will turn out. Energy wells up within me. My body purges, didn't notice. Energy again wells up within me. Head tilts, back arches and I started vocalizing, again didn't know what my body was doing. A shadow comes out of my eyes, mouth and body. Interestingly, later my partner, before I described what happened, asked what the shadow was that left me.\r\n\n\n\nIt was a monumentally bad decision that had brought this thing to me. And I now had to face it.\r\n\n\n\nSome quick background. When I was younger and dumber, I played around with Theban script, Crowley-esque darker arts, Blood Magic and the Necronomicon. And though the book that circulates and has since the 90s is not any real sort of power, intent is. Numerous times while playing with such things I actively sought out darkness.\r\n\n\n\nI knew I was going to face this shadow, what I did not know was how pathetically insignificant it was to me now. My guides, 5 of them rose up to stand with me. L\u00e6ohah and four who's names I know not yet. Here we are, a being of light and its 5 ally spirits and I am facing off a wisp of an impish spirit with red eyes in its smoky form.\r\n\n\n\nIts eyes dart past me to my spouse. Who is on tape saying she felt an evil presence leave me, look at her and she noted how I responded.\r\n\n\n\nMy head snapped to it and I drove it to the opposite side of the space, knowing it was looking into the mortal realm to where my partner sat. I began to unravel its darkness with speech in a language I do not know. It flowed out of me and my hands began to contract in various symbols rapidly. And I tore it apart with light, in the end a confused spirit was before me who had likewise lost its way. With the shadow torn from it, it was free once more and it thanked me before moving on.\r\n\n\n\nCheers erupted from around me, not over my victory for they knew I could accomplish that, but over how I saved rather than destroyed. Healed rather than killed. They assured me I could very well have ended it if I had so chosen to see that as my path. But that I would have lost my way again had I gone that route.\r\n\n\n\nSuddenly I am surrounded with entities great and small, geometric, fae, cyber, fractal, humanoid, insect, ancient. So. Many. Beings. I began to laugh ecstatically. They express an eagerness to one day meet me in person and get to know me, once I complete my journey of rebirth.\r\n\n\n\nI turn back to the stream to find all but one of my guides gone. His name I know not, but I know him as The Secret Keeper. He has Six Arms and floats in lotus position, his bottom two arms constantly forming sigils. His skin feels orange, and is lined with script in a language I did not recognize immediately. His face is made of impossible angles and 6 eyes surrounding his third eye. It was he who taught me to speak in the language of spirit and he assures me one day I will be able to do it without his help. It is he who taught me the hand sigils.\r\n\n\n\nHe asked me to walk with him. As we moved up the stream of energy we had chosen to walk, he said he wanted to impart something on me. But in order to do so he would have to enter my sacred temple and would only do so invited. Our souls touched. I was not repulsed and so I accepted his gift. He entered me and I began to chant aloud in a different language swiftly, my hands moving like lightning through sigils. Knowledge of things I am still grasping poured into me. As he entered me I felt so much energy inside me that I felt like I was about to explode. I felt as though lightning should be coming off of me. He stepped out of me.\r\n\n\n\nComing back to Earth consciousness was beautiful and I could feel the energy of life around me for hours afterwards. I know now for what I was chosen. A path that has called me time and again yet been unheeded. My path is the path of the Shaman. I am new upon it, I know nothing. I have nothing to give save humility and a willingness to learn. Time and further meditation, experience in nature, journeying will continue. I have no ego in this, whether I will ever be a Shaman is as of yet unknown; I can only walk the path and see where it leads."

        "report_text": "Me: Have used more psychedelics than I can remember.  I have been smoking weed every 1-2 hours for the last 15 years.  I've burned  out a lot of my receptors in my brain due to very large doses of so  many different things.  I consider myself to have a real problem with  drugs. They have destroyed my life and I can't seem to be able to let  them go.  I am a very smart person with an unbreakable intention to  help others every chance I get. I know I could have done things to  change the world. To make things better for everyone.  But because of  my string attachment to pleasure I have lost that chance, at least in  this life.  \r\n\n\n\nI don't know how much of this to report because it was a very long day.  Most of it was not more than a drugged state for having fun but I do need  to explain at least some of it.  If you wish to skip this and get to the  meaningfull part scroll down to where we took the DMT.    \r\n\n\n\nMy friends D and E come over early in the morning and we take some DOC. Me and E take 7mg DOC plus 1mg clonazolam (to cancel out the body load of DOC  At high doses). D takes 4mg DOC. \r\n\n\n\nI live in the capital and in this country there is a lot of crime. For  this reason we go up to this mountain.  Its a long hike.  About 45 minutes  up and at times its about a 45 degree incline.  We had to wait like  an hour for the bus so by the time we started the hike up the mountain we were tripping.  Prolly 1.1 hrs.  E is a ++++, me ++ (I do high doses of DOC  about once a week). D is still not tripping so much because of his lower dose.  \r\n\n\n\nNow this hike up this mountain is not easy.  The road is washed out and there  are loose rocks all over the place.  I am in good shape but its still a bitch.  E is not in good shape. I end up taking one of his bags to help him some but  Even though I have sweat pouring down my face, I am not tired. I'm sure it is  because of the DOC.   \r\n\n\n\nWhen we get to the top we sit down and enjoy the view.  You can see the entire  capital plus all the surrounding cities.  Very amazing but we continue to  another mountain that is a better spot.  Very difficult climb but so worth it.   We set up a blanket and some music to chill for a while. \r\n\n\n\nMe: 3mg DOC IM\r\n\nD: 2mg DOC IM\r\n\n\n\nIt takes like 5 minutes but after that we are both at +++++.  E had already  been at that level for the past hour.  D who had taken no clona was  experiencing some muscle tremors and because the wind was so strong it was  somewhat cold.  He said the combination made it painful. I offered him some  clona but he enjoys the rush of energy that DOC gives and the clona gets rid  of that so he doesn't want any.  For me I had a little bit of spasms for ten  or fifteen minutes but it wasn't much and then it went away.  \r\n\n\n\nEither way after a while the wind was too much and we decide to go back to the  other mountain.  At this time E wants to know why we are leaving.  He is very  concerned and paranoid all the sudden. This is not a complete surprise. We  know he has issues when in the middle of nowhere and tripping but we are no  strangers and it is not our first time tripping together.  Well we explain what  we are doing and begin to head back.   \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere was this dog that had found us up there.  He was very skinny and  obviously starving. We are in a mountain far from civilization and I feel  terrible for this dog so I gave him the food I had brought for myself.  The  poor guy ate it all and decided to come with us for a while. Eventually we  lose him but I still can't help feeling bad for the guy. \r\n\n\n\nAnyway, the way we came up the mountain was directly up the face of it. Very steep incline and all grass. For the way back we decide to go down this 'drain'  where all the water goes down when it rains.  Its carved a passageway through  the mountain maybe 25+ feet down.  Its really very beautiful and a great  experience. But after maybe 15 minutes and it turns pretty much into a tunnel  E gets very scared.  He wants to know where we are going and when will he get  back home.  He doesn't want to keep going any further but this is quite a bit  down this mountain; again at a very steep angle. We explain what it means to  turn around and after some time of trying to make him feel safe, we continue  down the 'path'.  The whole time is is very uncomfortable and stops and we  struggle to make him feel safe.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe are not strangers and its not our first trip together. He should not be  scared of us but this is a mountain where he has never been. It's a jungle  and he apparently doesn't have the same sense of adventure as we do and it's  not good for him. He has already warned me this could happen if we went to  a place like this but I really though it would be okay. We tried so much the  whole time to make him feel safe and he always wanted to leave. Somehow he had this idea that we would stay there all night.  I dunno why but his main priority was knowing if he was going back home.  It's quite the workout to get  up to the top of this place so the last thing we wanted to do was go back. My  friend explained this to him and even offered to take him back home but then he would feel bad and say he would stay.   \n\n\n\nWe stayed for an hour or so but then went back.  At that point he was paranoid  of why we were leaving. We simply were bored and it was cold but he took it differently. First he thought we were leaving because of him and later some  other things and didn't seem to wanna go back. Eventually we get in the bus  and all is well.   It was our intention to all smoke DMT up there but I really didn't think it was a good idea so after we dropped E off near his house we go to my house to continue  as planned.  And before I get started I just want to mention that I have never  had a worthwhile experience smoking DMT. I have not had any real breakthroughs,  even at 60 mg doses. With DOC I don't even have to close my eyes or anything  and even a small amount of DMT will have great results.  \r\n\n\n\n23 mg of DMT vaporized.\r\n\n\n\nEverything was inhaled in one hit.  My lungs, due to the long years of abusing and treating them like shit, are unable to feel DMT.  Weed is hard on my lungs for some reason and its hard to hold those in for too long but DMT is different.  Anyway normally I do feel it somewhat but this time I felt nothing.  I wasnt sure I had inhaled  anything so after about 15 seconds I blow it out.  A huge cloud  of smoke comes out so I definitely did it.  Usually DMT causes some very uncomfortable sensations, almost painful and this is before I  even blow anything out.  Well this time there was nothing.  After  about 30 seconds I'm starting to think it's not gonna do anything.  \r\n\n\n\nI was wrong.  \r\n\n\n\nWe were watching a video of Tiesto at UMF.  As I focus on the music everything is starting to move very fast. As I focus on the music everything is starting to move very fast.  My friend was sitting on the  couch also was moving about 3 or 4 times faster than normal. When I look directly at him he is now moving at normal time but now the music  playing in the background begins to go very very fast.  I turn to look  at the girl that's singing and she is moving normal.  I can see her  singing and everything is normal.  But the sound coming out of her  mouth is going much faster, still in synch with her lips somehow.  \r\n\n\n\nThis was not my first experiencing this sort of thing. After being in this place several times I believe what is happening is that my  consciousness is traveling through different dimensions.  Now, I'm not  going to explain here Einstein's theory of special relativity but it pretty much says that the faster you move through space, the slower you  move through time and vise versa.  The way I see it, since I'm now  traveling through normal space plus some other dimensional space as well,  this is going to slow down my movement though time. Of course I don't  expect anyone to believe that but it is the way I see it. \r\n\n\n\nI get bored with that and focus on what what is happening on  The stage and the laser lights that I have point on the ceiling. The  visuals on the stage are amazing. There is no tracers or anything of  the sort and nothing is moving or morphing but it is just amazing. It's  very difficult to explain what I was seeing but they were colors that I  had never seen before. The energy rushing into my body is almost  uncontrollable.  My body has no choice but to move with the music and  all I can think is 'Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit...' \r\n\n\n\nIt was all very amazing but that's when I notice the tree.  I have this  big tapestry of a tree hanging on my wall.  I see it everyday and know  bery well what this tree looks like.  But this wasn't the tree.  As I look  more deeply into it, somehow even though I did not notice any change, it is  again a different tree.  But now there is some sort of emotion I'm  experiencing and when I give myself to it I begin to sense some sort of  communication. This tree continues to change and show me me.  It took some  time to realize it but after a while I realized what was happening. \r\n\n\n\nThe tree was showing me my life.  It went through a progression of my  life.  At first, during my earlier years the tree was very healthy.  But  In time the tree has become sick.  It is dying and decaying.  This is not  just this lifetime but is showing my the past and future.  I really do not  like what I see.  I am actually a little bit frightened.  Now this is no  surprise too.  I know exactly the things that I've been doing and that they  will most likely lead to suffering. But this tree showed me very very well  where I was headed.  It wasn't just telling me about this life but far, far beyond. It was all very real. \r\n\n\n\nI'm positive this being that was manifesting itself as this tree was  trying show me this or perhaps help me in some way.  He was not some other  form of my self but a completely other entity.  I won't explain how I'm so  sure of this because it would make this much longer and not sure I even can  but theres is no doubt in my mind.  \r\n\n\n\nThe experience left me drained. This is not my first time with DMT and  afterwards I have plenty of energy but this time it was exhausting. This is not my first time with DMT and  afterwards I have plenty of energy but this time it was exhausting.   Usually I repeat the experience a couple times but this time I had no  desire to do so.  Quite the opposite actually. At least for some time. Nothing about the experience made me feel like I was having a bad trip.  Some of the things were frightening to realize but nonetheless, very  rewarding.\r\n\n\n\nThis experience has left me with much to think about and a very strong  desire and intention to change what I saw. My life needs to change and  that change needs to happen right now.  This have never been so clear  about this.  I have struggled with this for quite some time now but it's  been very difficult.  I now believe I can do it and have a very strong  conviction to do so as well as a new ally. \r\n\n\n\nNext was D.\r\n\n20mg DMT\r\n\n\n\nI really wanted him to see this tree so I switched spots with him and gave  him the DMT pipe.  Soon after he is in some sort of trance. He was looking  at the wall where the tree was but then focused in the space in front of  him more like staring at the ceiling. His eyes and mouth were completely  wide open.  The expression on his face was of awe but there was more to it.  He started to stick out his tongue in a very erotic licking motion. This  went on for quite some time pretty much until the end of the trip maybe 15 to 20 minutes. \r\n\n\n\nThis is what he said happened. At first he was looking at the video and the  kights on the wall and it was great. But then he saw the tree. It wasn't on the wall but coming towards him. At some point another entity came into him  And began controlling his body. It made him close his eyes and stick out his  tongue. The entire time eyes were actually wide open as far as they could  possibly be the whole time. This is still mind-blowing for him. \r\n\n\n\nThe moment that he (thought he) closed his eyes the space in the room began to  bend and do all sorts of funny things. To the right of him was a passageway.  There was a lot of creatures going through the tunnel. They had legs and  arms but were not human. Next this entity was taking my body and began to  examine it. I was up in some sort of floating machine that would flip, twist  and scan me. After it was done it showed whatever it was that it was trying  to do (he doesn't know) and my body was sucked into some sort of wormhole  looking thing and thats the last that he saw me until 'opened' his eyes.  \r\n\n\n\nHe was not frightened or anything throughout the experience but he was sure  his eyes were closed and that he had no control of his body. He is sure that  other creature was in his body controlling it while he was in the other  place. \r\n\n\n\nI think this was the most either of us ever [got] out of an experience.  Those images are still very clear and will not leave. I actually feel at  least a little more control over my problems. In the past I've felt as if I  will never be able to break these habits but now there is hope.   -shunyata"

        "report_text": "[Erowid Note: \nThe dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] close erowid-warning \n\n\nWell, where to begin? \r\n\n\n\nHere's my back story: I'm about 22 years old. As I write this, my first experience with drugs was, oh, about five or six weeks ago. I'd intentionally avoided drugs all of my life, viewing them as mindless and obnoxious. A younger friend of mine finally convinced me to try weed, and, well, let's just say that I changed my mind about drugs. Weed and I have become good friends.\r\n\nI've now smoked weed about a dozen times. After the fourth time I did it, this friend of mine mentioned that a mutual friend was going to do DMT that night. \r\n\n\n\nWhat's that?, I wondered. I loved weed and wanted to experiment with more potent drugs.\r\n\n\n\n'Um, no. You're not doing DMT. You've smoked weed like, four times. DMT is the most powerful psychedelic on the planet.'\r\n\n\n\nBut stubborn me being stubborn me, I insisted. I researched it for hours and concluded that I wanted to try. \r\n\n\n\nThe mutual friend was reluctant, but agreed to give me a smaller dose. He had half of a gram, and we were smoking with his makeshift bong -- he took about 150mg and he gave me about 50mg, which seemed to be much higher dosages than what most people online were taking. But I trusted him, so -- yeah. Being highly inexperienced, I only held the hits for a combined total of maybe six seconds. I got a buzz -- vibrations around my body, and, when I closed my eyes, a feeling like I was experiencing an out-of-body experience.\r\n\n\n\nThat alone was fascinating and something that everyone should experience. \r\n\n\n\nBut it wasn't enough. That's not what I read about. I vowed to get it right next time.\r\n\n\n\nWe ordered another gram, and, a little under two weeks later, we returned to the same place at the same time to give it another try.\r\n\n\n\nThe mutual friend, who is very experienced in these matters, knew what to prepare me for. We did some weed first so the ash could form a barrier in the bowl, blocking out the more pungent taste of the pure DMT -- a repulsive burning-plastic-type taste.\r\n\nI was told that I needed three good hits: inhale the first hit for ten seconds, inhale the second hit for ten seconds, and then, although your body will start giving out, you have to fight the effect and get a few seconds in of that last good, potent hit. The third hit, I was told, was critical -- it's the difference between an amazing trip and truly breaking through to the other side.\r\n\n\n\nThree of us were to do it. I went first. I was very nervous -- nervous that I wouldn't get my hits right, nervous about what I should expect with such an incredibly high dosage, nervous because I was going first -- but when it came time to smoke, I buckled down and did it. The first hit went in -- counting to ten -- and out -- then quickly reaching for the second -- in -- ten seconds -- and out --\r\n\n\n\nBy now my body was starting to rush. Things started to blur. But I summoned up the will to get a third hit. It went in and out in about three seconds. Then I laid down on the ground, onto my pillow, supremely confident that I'd done it right, and said 'Alright, here I go. Bye!'\r\n\n\n\nAnd fuck, I was gone. I was transported to another fucking dimension.\r\n\n\n\nBefore continuing with the experience, let me note that I was not conscious of anything. I wasn't communicating with anyone in the room -- I wasn't even aware that I was in the room. Some of the other experiences I've read talk about interactions with others and opening their eyes here and there to get the open-eye visuals -- Sorry to say, but they're missing out. I was knocked-out unconscious. Some people talk of 'egodeath.' I guess that's what I felt: I literally had no conception of myself. What in hell do I possibly say to convey to someone what exactly that means? There is no sober parallel to what that means. It doesn't even make sense: if there's no conception of the self, where is the 'I'? And yet -- that's what I felt. I was seeing things, I was being led through space, but it wasn't really 'me.'\r\n\n\n\nThe other side was like a rollercoaster ride. I had no choice but to sit back and be carried away as things unfolded in front of me. I -- or, my essence, my consciousness -- was just floating in space, detached from existence, not fighting anything, not trying to direct anything. It was like I was being given a spiritual tour of this parallel world.\r\n\n\n\nThe first thing that I remember is the imagery. The infinitely intricate, breathtakingly complex geometric images that I saw were indescribably beautiful. One pattern after another, in split seconds, unfolded. Dozens of them. They unfolded or melted away as quickly as they appeared. Glowing rainbow colors -- everything had an aura. It turned blue, green, yellow, hot pink, light orange -- unfathomably beautiful. And they kept coming and coming and coming -- It is simply astonishing that the mind is capable of such things.\r\n\n\n\nThen, it's like I'm in space -- pitch-black darkness, but with hundreds of glowing, rainbow stars in the background, shining beautifully. And I go past these holographic, glowing blue floors -- and then I saw -- them. They could be described as aliens or elves -- aliens, since I had the feeling of being in outer space; elves, because of their elongated ears. They were very thin, but not emaciated -- everything was proportional. Their bodies were comprised of triangular shapes, and were glowing blue, too, although they also had an aura.\r\n\n\n\nI saw several of them, though I remember certain images most vividly. I saw a family of three -- a mother, a father, and a young boy. She was pouring the boy cereal at the table as the father was at the stove, attending to something, talking to a client on the phone. I also saw two young women having coffee on a breezy weekday afternoon. I vaguely remember a man showing himself to me, as if he were about to go to work. But I didn't interact with them; they said nothing to me -- it was just this sense that this was their world, and, while things looked mundane, their lives were peaceful and didn't need any interference. I just had to keep going; my ride was taking me elsewhere. It was all happening so frustratingly quickly.\r\n\n\n\nAs I felt myself coming down and my consciousness restored, the images kept coming at me at a million miles a minute -- images that implicitly conveyed information, mostly evoking feelings of childhood and daily life, although they felt like so much more. Things were just coming and going at lightning speed -- there was hardly time to process any of it. It was simply an incomparable show, like a kaleidoscope of dream images, beautiful geometric shapes, and images that so perfectly conveyed particular feelings.  \r\n\n\n\nWhen I came to, all I could do for three minutes was pound the ground relentlessly, repeating variations of 'Holy shit!' and 'What the fuck?!' -- It was just pure astonishment, just utter disbelief at what I'd just experienced. I still felt 'in the experience' for another five minutes or so, -- my body was shaking, I was breathing heavily, and I was still able to feel out-of-body when I closed my eyes.\r\n\n\n\nMy friends said that I was out for 10-15 minutes. It felt timeless. When you're there, it's like you're in another dimension -- formless, floating, transcendental. All that matters is what's in front of you, and the intensity of the ride. I had no conception of anything while in the parallel world -- I had no sense of even existing. That other world was all that there was, and I was being shown its grandeur.\r\n\n\n\nPeople have hypothesized that people who think that they were abducted by aliens actually experienced an accidental release of DMT. I buy that theory. If I'd experienced that and had no idea why, you can be damn sure that I'd believe it were real. It also seems extremely plausible that this is what dying feels like -- a peaceful release.\r\n\n\n\nThis drug is powerful as all hell and probably the most intense positive experience I've ever had. It's a major life event for me and I think that everyone should try it out, if they think that they can handle it. \r\n\n\n\nTo go from my first bowl of weed to breaking through on DMT in the span of five or six weeks is pretty outrageous, but I don't regret it at all: nothing in the fucking world could possibly prepare a person for what they experience when they break through on DMT. My adventurous side took hold of me -- damn, that was amazing. I did my best, but nothing, nothing, nothing in the world can describe the beauty and intensity of DMT's parallel world."

        "report_text": "A Healing Experience with DMT\r\n\n\n\nSet and Setting\r\n\nI decided to take DMT after seeing a documentary about its effects on human consciousness. I smoked it out of my bong filled with weed stems. I was with my good friend. This friend and I have a complicated relationship because I loved him for a long time and he just never had feelings for me. Even though we have never been in a romantic relationship, we both openly recognize to each other that we share a special connection. We seem to get the other one in a certain way. I\u0092ve described it as being a building relationship. I have begun to understand human interaction as a transfer of energy. We have adjectives to describe this energy. It can be positive, negative, exciting, destructive\u0085.etc. After years of torment, I  tripped mushrooms with one of our good friends and this boy and I really came to peace with the fact that this boy was never going to see our relationship for the potential I knew. Coming to that place has been very good for me and it has allowed me to explore a new friendship with him. I still recognize my attraction to him but coming to peace with not having more has allowed me to hold back parts of myself that I need to when I interact with him. In my room, we took hits sitting on my bed with a bunch of pillows and blankets. He went first and his DMT didn\u0092t really work. His stuff was much older. But I had just gotten mine so it was fresh. \r\n\n\n\nThe Trip. \r\n\nI can see how this is going to be really hard to do with words. It was very fast. I felt it coming on so I handed the bong to my friend. My awareness didn\u0092t leave the room but my eyes uncontrollably rolled back into my head so I shut them. My friend was watching me and would tell me things like take a deep breath. I could sense his concern. On one hand I didn\u0092t want interruptions but on the other hand his instructions were helpful. On one hand I didn\u0092t want interruptions but on the other hand his instructions were helpful. I started seeing geometric patterns and I told him. They were red and green and I have seen them before from smoking weed but this time they were much more distinct and pronounced. \r\n\n\n\nThroughout the rest of the experience the lights were there swimming in front of me. They took the shape of the smoke that I had exhaled from my last hit. The image of the smoke was burned into my memory because that\u0092s when I felt the rushing feeling in my body and I wanted to lie down. As these colors were swirling around I noticed what felt like a wrenching battle. It was like my mind was fighting against it though. All I wanted to do to was surrender to the separation but my mind went into survival mode and the more I thought about it the worse it was until eventually my friend told me to let go and something about hearing his voice allowed me to relax. I eventually opened my eyes as if all of a sudden the drug had worn off. I opened my eyes and I turned and looked at my friend and tried to describe what had happened. We had a really open conversation and I felt very happy. \r\n\n\n\nI wasn\u0092t content though. I wanted to take another hit. I felt like I could break through on another hit. After a while of sitting up, I took the bong for another hit. My friend was distracted as I started hitting the bowl. I didn\u0092t realize how much was left and took a huge hit. I started coughing and after I gained my composure I tried to finish off what was left in the chamber but by the third pull I wasn\u0092t in control of my lungs anymore. I lay down and it was all so rapid. The colors came back and were swirling but the feelings I were having are what I want to focus on. \r\n\n\n\nI could feel an energy building in my body like it was preparing to shoot up and through me. My heart starting beating really fast just as it had done the first time but this time it slowed much faster. The energy that was building got to my throat and I took what seemed like an involuntary deep breath. Before that point I had felt a little like I was choking even though I could sense air coming in and out of my lungs. The energy stopped at my throat and all of a sudden a wave of feeling came over me. I felt like I hadn\u0092t felt anything that strongly since I parted with my last lover. She was the first girl I had ever been with and I had incredible passion for her. But she broke my heart and I have been recovering from that ever since. The feeling of the energy became so intense that I just started crying. However they weren\u0092t tears of sadness but more tears of relief. That was the first time I have been able to cry over what happened with me and this girl and it felt incredible to be able to surrender. My friend became concerned and came closer asking what was wrong. I told him that I just need to cry right now and that it felt amazing. His concern triggered my coming back to the room. Like the first time, I heard a buzzing or humming sound on my way down. I just lay there with my eyes closed for a moment. Again I opened my eyes and we talked. I explained to him about the girl a little which led us into a conversation about the type of girls he chooses to be romantically involved with. He really wanted to know what I thought so I was very honest with him. I feel like that was liberating for me to voice my opinions to him and also probably really insightful for him to hear, especially coming from me.\r\n\n\n\nReflection\r\n\nDMT is an incredibly powerful drug. I will definitely be trying it again at some point. I believe that being able to talk to my friend was very helpful during the experience but I could also see how talking can easily become a distraction. If used effectively I believe people could learn to harness the power of DMT. Humanity just needs to undergo a reshuffling of our priorities first. DMT is difficult to describe because it happens so quickly but during the experience I feeling incredibly loved. It feels like surrendering to God except the God that was there with me was myself, just an incredibly loving part of me. I feel so at peace with the world right now hours after taking DMT but I have already seen the fear begin to resurface in myself. It is as if for a moment I became one with the feeling of love and that momentary experience is giving me peace but already I feel my memory fading and my fears creeping back in. But I also feel like I better understand my fears and I am able to identify them more easily."

        "report_text": "Ok so this is the real account of my 1st ever DMT Trip. A complete breakthrough experience. Please read this! I have tired to be as accurate as possible. This account also includes A4 Drawings I drew in crayons straight after my experience on DMT. I am not a fantastic artist, but at the time I felt it very necessary to draw what I saw to help me remember it. I am not going to write you a novel, so I will jump straight to the point and include all the fantastic details! :)\r\n\n\n\nTo make this easier for me I will write this with a few headings as we go along.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Drugs I have Taken\r\n\n=========================\r\n\nHeroin, Meth, Ketamine, LSD, Mushrooms, 2cb, MDMA, Marijuana, Probably more I'm forgetting.\r\n\n\n\nYeah I have really experimented alot. I just got off bupremorphine acouple of months ago for my 8~ week heroin addiction :/ (dont take heroin btw.)\r\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting:\r\n\n===============\r\n\nI am in my girlfriends jewelery workshop in her house in Australia, its about 10:00pm at night, we have been smoking marijuana most of the day and I have just scored some DMT for the first time. I am eager to try it as I have read much about it, but my girlfriend is somewhat skeptical it will even work (She has had LSD before - how different could it be? ...haha) So we are in a small comfortable room at night, and im a nice comfy couch-like seat.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance:\r\n\n=============\r\n\nIts a very yellowy crystal, its sticky almost. Its well refined to a degree, but I suppose it could be more dry and more crystaly. Its damn good though. I believe it to be NN,DMT. In australia DMT is everywhere, Acacia Tree's, Red Reed Grass etc... I believe this to be extracted from acacia tree's at a golf course :)\r\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoking it through a bong!:\r\n\n============================\r\n\nOk so here we go, I pack a cone and put on a liberal dose of DMT. I cant really tell you how much I put on because I dont even know the strength or how well refined my DMT is, or how many 'mg' I put on my cone. If this helps, about [       ] that much. about 3/4 the size of the fingernail on your index finger. I pull the bong and hold in for about 3 seconds, then let out all the smoke. It tastes fairly shit but I don't really mind at all. I put down my bong promptly and relax back into my chair waiting for shit to happen.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n+10 seconds after I pull\r\n\n==========================\r\n\nI close my eyes. There is a massive rushing sensation like my head is being sucked up into space. It almost forces me to close my eyes. The visualizations start. at first it starts like a Windows Media Player visualization, streaming lines coming towards me from the center of my vision. I feel like I am traveling through my vision. At this point everything starts to increase in intensity very fast...\r\n\n\n\n\n\n+30 seconds after\r\n\n=========================\r\n\nOk this is very extreme now. This is unlike anything Ive had before. What I'm seeing is geometric patterns everywhere, in incredible detail. All kinds of shapes I have never seen before. Its impossible to describe. It overwhelms me completely. \r\n\n\n\n\n\n+60 seconds after\r\n\n============================\r\n\nThis is where it gets really interesting. At this stage I am completely immersed in a different reality. I am aware that I am sitting in my gf's workshop, somehow. I am faintly aware that Im even sitting down, but what I see is tremendously overwhelming. Have you seen the movie 'Cube' or 'Cube:Hypercube?' - if so, imagine falling OUTSIDE the cube's, endlessly falling... my whole reality has changed. I am falling outside these cubes but what I'm seeing is endless green cubes coming right up to my minds eye. They are green cubes, with RED RUBY eyes, and they have a great white shark's mouth. I am not shitting you. I drew a picture and it looks crazy.  How could I draw something that insane? I can barely even draw!!\r\n\n\n\nThe cubes have a distinctly female presence. Its soo wierd. I can actually tell the SEX of the Cubes? Are they are inatimate visualizations? But they feel like they have a PERSONALITY!? This is extremely overwhelming. I said that already but its understated OK? At this point I start moaning... Im like 'urghhh'... my girlfriend knows I am experiencing an insane trip so she comes over to comfort me. She touches my shoulder to comfort me and she tells me 'Its alright just relax you will be ok.' At the time I cant even identify where she is touching me, it feels like I am in a liquid bubble, I can feel her 'energy' touching me but its impossible to even pinpoint where on my body Im being touched. Even the couch im sitting on feels like its melted into the bubble. For all intensive purposes I am floating in an entirely different reality.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediately after being comforted on the shoulder:\r\n\n===================================================\r\n\nSo straight after she touches me. Almost immediately, her comforting touch transports me out of the Cube dimension into a purple vortex room. This shit was soo complex I couldn't even draw it. Basically as she touched me it started like a sweeping motion in my vision. From my very right to my very left it was a COMPLETE windscreen wipe motion into a different reality. It happened in about 3 seconds of 'real time'. Holy hell it was amazing. And relieving. What I saw was a purple room, with completely different dimensions than the room we are in. When I say dimensions I mean that we are in a small room about 15-20-30?m squared. But my depth is soo different I feel like Im in a purple HOUSE. There is paintings on the wall, Everything is purple and wavy, The crazy thing to note here is that the dimensions have completely changed!! I literally feel I am in a different world and I am in a house that could be the size of a mansion. For example if I stood up and ran, I could run for hundreds of meters. It was truly spectacular. Also there was a staircase!!!! What the hell LOL! I have never seen this house in my life. At this stage I was just soo happy and relieved to be out of the cube dimension and into something new and comforting.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nOPENING MY EYES!\r\n\n==================\r\n\nOk after only god knows how long of being in the purple room, actually it must of only been about 30 seconds. I felt that I could open my eyes. What happens next is truly, truly insane. I will try to describe the best I can. When I open my eyes. What I can see is the actual reality of the room. So I can see where I am sitting, where my girlfriend is, the table/chair/tools in the room etc. BUT: The whole world is like it has foam cut outs over it! Imagine that you took a photo of the room you are in, then when the photo was developed, it was life sized, and for every object in the room, you took a peice of coloured foam and stuck it around the edges of the object.\r\n\n\n\nI dont even know what my gf looked like because I was soo focused at this swively chair (with the back missing) sitting in the middle of the room. The swively chair (more like a swively seat) Had googely eyes on it and was made out of Foam with cutouts all around it. Like a linocut! Definition: Linocut is a printmaking technique, a variant of woodcut in which a sheet of linoleum (sometimes mounted on a wooden block) is used for the relief surface... Anyway I swear to you it had googley eyes stuck on it, and it was green and red and blue, and the whole room was different coloured. EVERY COLOUR in the room was different. It was sooooo shocking and almost frightening that this chair was staring at me with its googely eyes that I had to close my eyes again. When I say googley eyes, I mean like a circle shaped peice of plastic with a white background, and a smaller black peice of plastic circle inside it.\r\n\nLike a plastic eye you would get on a toy. but BIG!\r\n\n\n\n\n\n+30 seconds later\r\n\n===================\r\n\nOk I must of been in the trip about 4-5 mins now but for all intensive purposes it might as well of been 45+ mins. It felt like forever. This part coming up is the most exciting/favourite part of the whole experience. I am starting to 'come-to', back into reality. Colours are returning to normal around me (I think?) my eyes are open (I think?). But what happens next is truly profound. In the room, emerges this huge aztec structure... Yes Aztec! It had a huge personality. It wasnt male or female, but when I say presence, its like there was another human in the room, you can feel a strong energy unlike an inatimate object. This thing was living. This living aztec structure emerged infront of me with swirling symbols on it, and it had 2 HUGE Arm-like rings around it. It was litterally SHINING down upon me as I look up in total awe at its magnificience. Its shining soo bright down upon me and it dwarfs everything in the room, it also extends past the roof of the ceiling of the workshop we are in. It is gleaming down upon me, when suddently - it shakes its arm like wooden things, and then all these flags drop down with shining blue eyes in the flags. There is a huge ringing in my ears like the sound of angels from heaven showing me something amazing. I was already jaw-open totaly in awe of its beauty when it then did that, and it was just totaly amazing.\r\n\n\n\nAt this stage my trip is coming to an end and the aztec structure slowly fades away. The only words that could come out of my mouth as I return back to normal was 'omfg....ohh my fkn gawd...ohh my fkn god....x repeat 50' I just didnt know what else to say. From what I understand, my experience was a complete breakthrough experience, compared to other reports and what other people have told me, I was really transported to another reality, not just recieving faint visuals.\r\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Comments:\r\n\n================\r\n\nWhen my girlfriend smoke her DMT, she was so blazey about the whole thing like it was nothing new, her hand litterally just opened after she smoked the bong, and it slipped from her hand. I caught it just in time lol. She was obviously taken by surprise. She did some moanning too, but she only saw 'a bright white light and shining patterns'. She had the same dose as me but failed to describe in any detail what she saw, which was kind of a bummer I guess. but no biggie.\r\n\n\n\n30 minutes after smoking, I felt fully functional, My brain was working perfectly, I didnt feel wrecked in any way. Although there was lingering colour effects for at least 45~ mins. I actually had some more DMT that night, but it was too soon after my last experience so it didnt do much. It just warped my colours and it wasnt strong at all.\r\n\n\n\n---- If you have read this far, thankyou soo much for reading my experience."

        "report_text": "This is a very long report; you just gotta read it all to get it at all.\r\n\n\n\nI've been searching for the answer to a few big things; like how everything exists, what forever is, what is beyond this reality, who we are, purpose, is this a creation, what am I and how am I conscious, etc.  And after a life of thinking and wondering and analyzing and theorizing, I realize there is a block on our consciousness and thinking, that will only let us go so far when trying to comprehend the existence of everything to a point (within this reality), before automatically retracting our ability to perceive the answer, even question wholly.  This spawns a whole new question, why and how does this block exist (this question is my new focus until I find the answer, which will most likely, if I ever find it, need an answer to the answer)...  well, I've learned some answers (not before I unlearned) that I knew existed (absolute truths) deep inside, but couldn't wrap my mind around them in this state of being to perceive and understand.  Before my DMT experience, I pondered on universal truths with the problems above, and did not know if we would ever become enlightened, even after death.  \r\n\n\n\nThe only tryptamines I've done are psilocybin about a dozen times and Ayahuasca once before this experience.\r\n\n\n\nIn order to express something you must first perceive it in the reality you intend to express it in. Which is why I'm about to unsuccessfully explain my DMT trip to you.  :p\r\n\n\n\nAt best I can simply half-way explain PART of this thing/event/everything that happened as a lot of it would be a waste of effort to try and explain. The best analogy I could think of:\r\n\n\n\nInfinity = Dictionary definition of infinity\r\n\n\n\n'Infinity'= DMT infinity/s; the incomprehensible previously unperceivable truths and realizations shown by the DMT experience equivalent to the infinity of this 'normal'\u009d state of reality, except wholly perceivable in the DMT state. \r\n\n\n\nTake infinity.  So, we know infinity exists in this reality, we are certain, but we cannot perceive what it is, right?  To know something exists without being able to perceive it is compelling enough.  DMT enables me to simultaneously enter a completely different state of being previously unknown to existence whilst becoming one with everything that is happening and is being, thus completely comprehending and perceiving these new 'infinities'\u009d and the world the 'infinities'\u009d exist in in their entirety, all at the same moment.  This is just one poor attempt at expressing a part of it, it's something you have to experience.\r\n\n\n\nThe pre-DMT moments~\r\n\n\n\nIt was a Saturday night and my friend and I dropped some good acid at a rave, having never tripped at a rave, or with more than a few people for that matter, I quickly realized hundreds of faces and voices + pounding EDM (electronic-dance-music) + LSD= super anxiety, so we bargained a ride home early.  The bargain- we had to buy some of her DMT.  It was about 2:00 AM when we got to my buddy's house, the pretty rave girl pulled out of her nomnomnommy cleavage, the universe wrapped in a bitty crumb of tin-foil and gave it to us in exchange for a piece of green paper.  I knew that DMT was the ultimate psychedelic, the fuckin' Caddy.  And the shit wasn't to be taken lightly.  Well we went inside and just kinda sat and thought in silence for a good while about what we were about to do before we prepared the bowl.  And the significance, I mean, this is as far as it goes.  Smoking DMT.  Supposedly the ultimate life experience.  The substance smelled and appeared just as McKenna described his first dose of DMT, orangish, smelled kinda like scary moth balls, except mine wasn't in crystalline shape anymore, it had been smooshed to powder, but that obviously didn't damper the experience. \r\n\n\n\nWe went outside.  By now it is nearly 4 in the morning, so we weren't worried about someone stumbling upon us in the apartments.  We sat on the grass, the same grassy area where I've tripped many times.  There was a dead tree to the left that always had some weird significance to me, and a clear starry sky above.  We sat cross-legged about a foot apart from each other and I thought, still tripping acid 'Am I ready for this?'\u009d  Right when I thought this, I looked to left, and about 20 feet away was a deer, standing in the middle of the apartment complex, staring me dead in my eyes.  I asked 'Is that a deer.'\u009d  My friend said 'yeah'\u009d and I lit the bowl.  This took away any doubt I had about the authenticity of psychedelics being 'real'\u009d.  And not just some random chemical that fucks us up.  You can imagine what this did for my trip.\r\n\n\n\nFirst 3 or so minutes of trip~ \r\n\n100 mgs were in the bowl, but I probably smoked about 70 mgs\r\n\n\n\nI don't really remember the timeline except the come up, peak, then baseline.  In a 3 minute eternity on earth, in this life (this 'life' is so short compared to infinity, it's literally nothing) and since I knew what forever was, the thought of being dead in a matter of 'time' was extremely unnerving and terrifying, as time doesn't exist in infinity.  Hell I still woulda been freaked if we live a million years),  a few of those ultimate questions, and truths,  were WHOLLY, viciously, intensely blasted unto the being of my very existence an infinite (yes, I could comprehend infinity!) number of times like two universal mirrors reflecting each other into infinity, without mercy, for I dared to merge with the spirit of the universe and beyond, something that is an unyielding all-knowing one-ness that will un-teach and probe into your soul, so that it can re-teach what 'real'\u009d is, what matters. It enables the understanding that there are other ways, and there are places where (wherever DMT takes your soul) this universe is nothing and doesn't exist, and re-teach the way everything is in this one of infinite ways existence can be.   \r\n\n\n\nLast 2-3 minutes of trip~\r\n\nAfter the peak, I (Didn't know 'I'\u009d existed at the time, so assume 'everything that is one'\u009d for 'I'\u009d. 'Everything that is one'\u009d is the best way to describe it even though it's impossible to express in any form of communication besides through the Spirit Molecule what 'I'\u009d actually was.) was in the process of re-realizing everything I had ever known of existing in this life after unlearning  and then learning, knowing, comprehending and ultimately being completely one with another existence, consciousness, reality, state of being, universe, dimension, and everything entirely that I never knew was possible or existed in 3 minutes time.  It's an unbelievable irony that I could completely comprehend this state I was in and the impossibilities that I was completely wrapping my mind around, in and out of.  I mean, it was far more complex and higher than anything humans could perceive, but in this normal world where physics and matter exists, we have been for our entire existence yet we can't think past numbers!\r\n\n\n\nI uttered 'water' to my friend, who was sitting across from me the whole time through the experience.  I needed something, and since I was starting to become re-connected by a thread, I could utter what I need to live here, but I still wasn't sure anything would happen when I said water, because I learned what 'water'\u009d is during this life, but had just unlearned, so I didn't know that water was or existed even though I said it. Frankly, it scared the piss outa me.  'I'\u009d thought 'I'\u009d needed whatever it could be or was.  Well he didn't get me the water; I probably would have been back by the time he got it anyway.  So about a minute after I asked, hyper-ventilating, tears streaming down my face, freakin the fuck out, I went and poured a glass of water and sipped it, thankful I wasn't shitting myself about water being real, because nothing could've been better at that moment than cold, smooth, pure liquid life flowing down my spicy DMTed esophagus.  God, that smell, that taste.  So unnerving.  I cried/laughed/moaned/gasped at the impossibility of what just happened for about 20 minutes afterwards, and was outright sobbing for a few minutes at one point.  I was awake for about an hour after the toke before I smoked to get to sleep, else I woulda been up for ages.\r\n\n\n\nThe visuals were the most intense I've ever experienced, except they weren't visual visuals, like; I saw them in between my eyes and brain?  Third eye?  I apologize for not giving full detail of the visual experience, I know they were outrageous, but honestly I don't remember very much of what I 'saw'\u009d.  I don't think my brain had room for everything it was becoming, so it kinda didn't remember the less important things.  Tight coiling maze-like patterns with eyes closed at one point coming up, then a visual part of the peak I do remember is just kinda a few frames when I was looking at my friend in the eyes, and there was a line divided symmetrically through him with 'everything'\u009d constantly cycling through each side, although each side was different, it was exactly the same because of the constant balance kept by the cycling, (sort of like how when you spin a top it stays upright) and the perfect symmetry together with the 'one' I was perceiving/becoming kept it perfect.  Everything I witnessed was in beautiful, impossible, chaotic, terrifying, synchronous, harmony.  This scene was being blasted into me along with an infinite number of infinities, and reflected back infinite times.  If there is anything in this world that can represent DMT visuals its Alex Grey's work, but you still can't get close.  I don't fuckin know man It/I/everything was just all one. \r\n\n\n\nIf you've never experienced DMT, chances are you don't get 90 % of what I'm saying.  A DMT trip makes complete sense, just not in this state/universe/where whatever.  Or maybe you kinda get it I don't know.  All I KNOW is that Dimethyl-tryptamine is the answer to the fucking universe and that's why it's illegal.  Mother earth and what she yields, including each other, is everything we need to be happy and sustained.  Period.  The DMT experience has left me with a lasting euphoria and peace of mind that would be the ultimate anti-depressant."

        "report_text": "13/12/15I had no intention of tripping last Sunday. I was convalescing after a one-two punch - a taxing visit home and an exhausting marriage session of my best friend. After coming back, I went to a Battles gig this Friday which was (needless to say) stupendous and loud. I had tinnitus of the left ear till Saturday. My friend (Ar) who was also at the gig mentioned that he had tried out some new psychoactive and might get the opportunity to score it again.\r\n\n\n\nOn Sunday I woke up well rested. Ar called up to say he was coming over with another mutual friend (R). My younger brother (B) came over for lunch and stuck around when they came. Apparently, Ar had managed to get his hands on some Changa. I had never heard of it so I instantly googled it and only found a blog with an intro page. So I dived into the Erowid vaults and learnt of this latest phase in the evolution of Ayahuasca rituals. \r\n\n\n\nAnother bunch of friends had called a shaman down to a hill station nearby and tripped on Yaje, the drink, in a ritual setting with him in march this year. Changa is smoked. I had once tried to smoke DMT crystals in a glass pipe almost a decade ago in college. We didn't have enough for more than a hit each back then and on top of that, as novices, we didn't know how to burn it properly so the effect left a lot to be desired. Last time I tripped was during the bachelor party of my best friend at the end of September this year, though it was pure MDMA, an empathogenic, which he sourced from a doctor. Last time I tripped on a hallucinogenic was last year in October on shrooms at another friend's bachelor's.\r\n\n\n\nI was curious now about this drug that had appeared although, anal and anti-social as I am, I was also a bit miffed that my plan for Sunday, of reading alone, was no longer an option. Mostly, I was worried about B - we have been smoking weed for a long while but he has never tripped on proper psychedelics. Much like me, he spent his twenties in a self-destructive manner and I had warned him that psychedelics bring psychological conflicts to the surface in an unpredictable and uncontrollable manner - no drug is as strong as the hormonal concoction that starts running in our veins after puberty. Thank god he heeded my advice and the turbulent phase of life is (hopefully) behind us now. That doesn't mean he has learnt anything though. B pleaded that he did have experience with psychedelics because he had done Ketamine so I explained to him that's the exact opposite of a psychedelic - a tranquilizer cuts off the senses rather than overloading them.\r\n\n\n\nSo we started setting up. The ice bong had been out of service for months so we took it out of the closet and cleaned it thoroughly. Ar cleaned the pipe with isopropyl alcohol. I have an empty hall in my flat (only white lights, no decorations, wallpapers or carpets, no tv either). We shifted one of the single-seater couches next to the balcony's sliding glass doors to look out on the beautiful evening sky, smog-free and incandescent blue. My balcony is at one edge of the apartments' campus looking out on an unconstructed field with overgrown vegetation due to frequent afternoon showers. Children still find a way in to play soccer. It must have been around five when Ar took the first changa bong hit. Kangding Ray was playing on a Jawbone system.\r\n\n\n\nI was also worried my lunch would come back out from the purging effects of psychedelics in general and ayahuasca in particular so I rolled a thin small joint (5-6 drags) of changa and tobacco first. It felt much stronger than any pot I had come across. My fingers tingled and my hands felt like a plant leaf with slight condensation on it. I reached the mild euphoria of the post-trip state directly without actually tripping. I reached the mild euphoria of the post-trip state directly without actually tripping. Language became a labour.\r\n\n\n\nNow I was anticipating my first changa bong hit. After R & B, it was my turn. I sat on the couch and lit it. As I rolled my head back, I broke out in cold sweats. I was feeling cold before but now suddenly my body needed the cold breeze coming in. Every pore opened up to welcome the climate. The trees in the field and the railing of the balcony came unmoored from their foundation and became abstract geometric patterns. There was no noticeable auditory hallucination tho. Movement and speaking were out of the question for five mins.\r\n\n\n\nThe first bong hit was just my body getting used to this new substance. The sweats and the palpitations were familiar from shroom-tripping. Unlike shrooms, there was no adrenaline rush that blanks out various bodily pains. I was looking forward to the second hit. This time, the auditory hallucinations came on stronger, that weird soundscape that psychedelics open up where the sound doesn't just come from the speaker but from the room as such, every delayed frequency noticeable. How can you be inside a room and yet hear the room as a speaker, which would require the listener to be outside? The sound came in quantized packets and left trails, just like the light.\r\n\n\n\nIt was now almost dusk. The sky had turned ink blue. My balcony faces west so the clouds were still reflecting the light of the setting sun. The spectrum from a glowing pink to raven purple was being reflected by the clouds over the blackening sky. I got up and walked out to the balcony. A building to the extreme right was also bathed in indigo hue. I thought I was still tripping but it was actually outdoor UV lighting. The second hit was much more intense. My body had become used to Changa and was allowing it to do its thing. I noticed the signature collapse of psychedelics - the inability to physiologically separate dream state from waking life. At its peak, the Kaleidoscopic patterns were independent of whether my eyes were closed or open. Illumination and darkening were following their own rhythm, free of ambient cues. \r\n\n\n\nAt the end of my second trip, the album got over. Now I was really excited for the third hit, anticipating the DMT 'breakthrough'. I took over the music. R was gearing up for his third hit and I played Rustie's Glass Swords. It didn't feel like the best choice for tripping considering its all squeaky clean, chrome polished, now familiar sounds after a decade of dubstep. So I wanted to play something with dissonance, ambience and unfamiliarity - music that carries a life-world in itself. So I decided on Burial's EP 'Rival Dealer'. \r\n\n\n\nThat third hit was everything I expected and more. The opening bars of the opening song of the EP was playing, Burial sampling some old school jungle, when I took the hit. Almost instantly I warped elsewhere. The music trailed out into a distant ringing and stroboscopic light points appeared outlining space and volume. The music trailed out into a distant ringing and stroboscopic light points appeared outlining space and volume. The ringing became quite loud and I panicked about tinnitus coming back with a vengeance when the visuals took over completely. The stroboscopic lights morphed into Kaleidoscopic textures and planes forming a new reality. I was in the mirror room at the climax of Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon, except this time the room was multi-dimensional instead of just four walls and the walls didn't reflect each other as much meld at various points in a fractal design, form over physics. I also knew (I don\u0092t know how) that the \u0091dragon\u0092 was some female designer, not a kung fu master. \r\n\n\n\nShe wanted me to appreciate her design skills and told me the room was made out of alien material whose closest analogue in our world was plastic. So I was in this rapidly reforming room where it made no sense to ask of simple physical questions like 'which direction is up?' or 'am I standing?'. Then, the felt presence of this alien termagant vanished and the 'walls', so to speak, started to close in. They didn't close in as much as I realized that there was no longer any separation of inside/outside, body/habitat - just a floating perspective with no anchor. The planes of the kaleidoscope started shifting in opposing directions and I felt like I was travelling through a wormhole. At this point, I was attacked by the most uncanny feeling yet - this 'plastic' that she had talked about, it was not entirely molded by her. It was forming and reforming on its own. It was not just expanding and contracting... it was breathing. The 'plastic' was ALIVE! I was travelling through a biomass wormhole, a galactic vagina (if you will).\r\n\n\n\nI was scared, just like every other time, that I had gone too far. I was blaming myself for being childish in the enthusiasm for a new experience for which we risk our sanity and play with death in small doses. Only ten minutes had passed irl. The first track had ended with the sample 'Come back to us'. As the second track of the EP started, I came back to earthly life. I was in that powerless state where you hold onto the music as if your life depends on it, as if every sample and sound is super-significant and portentous. Burial was evoking the nineties in his style with samples of music from that era being played by someone entering a car and switching on the tape player. The clicks, the tics, the ghostly distant sounds, the tape hiss - It all gave me intense deja vu. The sense of false memory was so strong when I knew for a fact that I had never tripped to this EP.\r\n\n\n\nThe visuals had quieted down by now even though my eyes were still jittery. Movement left a trail. Ar & R went to get something to drink. B rolled a cig for me. I put on Jo Def's EP but it was too polished and hi-fidelity so I switched to Com Truise for more analog electronics and tape FX from the eighties. Ar & R came back with Amrut whisky. B wanted another hit. I realized that my worry about B was a projection - I was worried about loosing my self permanently, a worry I projected onto him. No one is as overwhelmed during trips as I am - they talk, move, dance. I become paralyzed and mute. I wanted B's final hit to be excellent too so I played Fly Lo's Los Angeles album for him. After that, everyone but me had a whisky drink, followed by a weed chillum and a hash chillum which I did partake. We finished off with the evening with some acid-damaged jams of Sun Araw in a throwback to the original hippie scene. Comedowns are the only time endless guitar noodling makes sense.\r\n\n\n\nI believe we went through a gram of Changa in eleven hits (plus a teeny j), which comes to approximately ~0.08 g per hit. The main problem, especially as I age, with psychedelics I did over the last decade (acid, shrooms, MDMA) is the investment of time. Quite simply put, I have grown tired of overnight raves which leave you fatigued and useless for a couple of days before you can trip again. This time around, we did it in the afternoon to evening period and Changa gave us more control over because an episode lasts ten-fifteen mins. It is more of a visual hallucinator than acid or shrooms which affect the perception of acoustic space more intensely and on a much more extended timeline (acid effects even beyond the trip cut-off point). \r\n\n\n\nOn a personal level, this was the first time that I tripped in my house, the first time that my brother B tripped on any psychedelic, the first time we tripped together and the first time all of us tripped on Changa. I award it full ten points for turning an uneventful Sunday into a novel experience. No psychedelic has ever been as spectacular as Changa for me."

        "report_text": "Mushrooms + DMT: A Magical Combination\r\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my account of taking a dose of DMT while peaking on a shroom trip. First I want to lay out my experiences with both DMT and shrooms. I recently acquired around a gram of DMT and had been enjoying the trips I had experienced. I had used DMT about 5 times prior to this experience. All of these trips consisted of intense visuals, and a general euphoria of the mind and body. I had not really felt the spiritual side of DMT that I have read about. I have also tripped shrooms 4 times prior and had some wonderful trips, most notably when I did 5 grams. \r\n\n\n\nAnyways, on to the report. It was Friday when I got a call from my most trusted psychedelic companion, my Brother, that he had gotten shrooms for us to do. I hadn\u0092t planned on going home from school, but my plans quickly changed once I had this news. We planned to trip Saturday night at another friends house that was out in the woods. I had in the back of my head an idea that I wanted to try DMT on shrooms.\r\n\n\n\nSaturday I spent the day outside kayaking, and had an amazing day. Driving home from kayaking the anticipation of doing shrooms was building. It had been a while since I had last done them and man, was I excited. I got home, ate a little dinner, smoked some weed, and my brother and I left for our friends house. We arrived at about 8:30, and I informed them of my plan to smoke DMT at the peak of my shroom trip. They thought it was a great idea, and at 9:00 we all ate 1/8 of an ounce of shrooms. Immediately after eating the shrooms I prepared a pipe with a dosage of DMT. I\u0092m not entirely sure of the dosage because I did not have powder scales with me and just eye-balled what I put in. My guess is I put in about 60-80 mg of DMT in a pipe with a small amount of weed. \r\n\n\n\nAt about 9:30 my brother, who I will refer to as B, and other friend, who I will refer to as L, both began to feel the effects of the shrooms. I didn\u0092t feel them coming on yet, so we smoked some weed and I enjoyed watching them experience the onset. At about 10:00 the mushrooms began to creep up. The body tingling I typically feel on mushrooms began and I knew they were setting in when painting on the walls and plants began to wave and bend slightly. \r\n\n\n\nBy 10:30 my visuals were getting more and more intense. Colors were shifting, and things were bending and twisting much more. There was also an emotional high I felt, that I couldn\u0092t remember being so profound this early into any of my other shroom trips. \r\n\n\n\nAt about 11:00 I decided I wanted to walk outside and see what it was like. It was a beautiful night, completely clear and we were far enough out in the woods that there was very little light pollution. I looked up at the stars for about 10 minutes, just staring in awe at the tiny dots of light and watching them shift colors and sparkle and move around in my minds eye. It was a truly beautiful thing to see. Then suddenly I hear an extremely loud screeching sounds coming up the valley we were in. I had no idea what it was but it completely overwhelmed by hearing. I saw lights coming out of the woods, and it appeared as though a train was coming up the valley! My mind was scrambling for an explanation, did I just hallucinate an entire train?! I quickly ran back inside, not able to handle the overwhelming sound that the train was producing. I asked L if there were railroad tracks across the valley and he said yes. I was relieved that what I had just seen was real, and that the mushrooms weren\u0092t making me go completely crazy yet. \r\n\n\n\nIt was about 11:30 now and the mushroom trip and fully set in. My visuals had become much more intense as plants in the room began to twist and seemed to curl around themselves. A painting L had done was hanging on the wall and as I started to examine it, the painting seemed to sigh and shift colors. It was very interesting and I watched it for about 10 minutes. About this time I went and got the DMT pipe, so that I had it ready when I wanted. \r\n\n\n\nAbout 12:00, midnight, I felt like I was peaking on the shrooms. The visuals had become the most intense they had been all night, and I had reached a point where a feeling of \u0093Oneness\u0094 and unity had taken hold. I held the DMT pipe in my hands for about 10 minutes, contemplating what I was about to do and preparing my mind and body for it as best I could. \r\n\n\n\nSuddenly my mind and body told me the time was right, and with no warning I took 4 very large hits from the pipe. The taste of DMT overwhelmed my mouth, and made it very difficult to take the last two hits. After taking the last hit, I set the pipe down and within 5 seconds my vision exploded. I literally do not know how else to describe it. I wasn\u0092t even looking at anything particularly interesting, but nonetheless colors and extremely complex geometric shapes and lines burst into being right in front of me. They grew and shrank and shifted from one shape to another, from one color to another. All of the colors where extremely bright, and seemed to have a light source of their own. \r\n\n\n\nVery quickly my vision was drawn to L\u0092s fish tank. The fish inside had patterns on their scales that changed every few seconds and as they swam around I watched their colors change from silver, to orange, to purple and any other color you can imagine. I then became affixed on a plant growing in the fish tank called Java Moss (If you don\u0092t know what it looks like, Google it).  This plant began to seethe and roll and twist around it self. There was a dark spot in the center that it all revolved around. This was within 5 minutes of smoking the DMT. I watched this plant for a few minutes and it continued to roll and twist around at varying speeds. I suddenly became aware a peculiar and unique energy that I still cannot explain. This energy came up and embraced me as I watched the Java Moss. As I watched the moss I began to realize that this energy I felt was not something internal, but actually was present in the moss! Even the fish seemed to be a part of it! It was truly incredible and at this moment my ego was completely shattered. I will never forget this feeling and the complete loss of self that occurred. All I could do was sit back and watch as the fish swam around and the moss seethed, both of them connected to this same energy that I was connected to. \r\n\n\n\nI tried to explain to L what I was seeing and how wonderful it all was. He immediately asked if I wanted to touch the moss. I was taken back a little, as I had not thought of this. Immediately I wanted to, I literally could not resist, I had to touch the moss. As I approached to moss it seemed to slow down and become much more still, almost as if it sensed what I was about to do. I stared at the moss, wanting to make sure that it was ok for me to touch it. I don\u0092t know what told me, but something in my mind told me it was ok, and I placed my hands in the tank and on the moss. \r\n\n\n\nI was hesitant at first, as I wasn\u0092t sure how the moss would feel or react to me. The moss was incredible to the touch. It was extremely soft, and it seemed to float around my hands and lightly touch my skin. Everywhere it touched I could feel acutely, as if the energy I was connected to was linking with the plant. I felt a sudden urge to grab the moss and feel it in my hands. As soon as I did this an extreme rush of emotion came over me. It was if I was linked to the plant, and the fish in the tank, and not just the tank but as if I was linked to this great energy that was present everywhere! I stared at the Java Moss as I held it in my hands and what I saw and felt is very difficult for me to describe. It was if I could see this energy flowing between the plant, between the water, between the entire universe, and me! As I stared at the moss it began to seethe and roll, slowly but getting faster and faster. Suddenly the energy began to guide my thoughts, and I began thinking very heavily about life, and where I was going and all the things that I had been going through lately. This energy seemed to come in and help me answer many of the questions that I had been trying to answer. It was almost as if the universe was telling me not to worry, that this energy that I was sensing is there, and always will be to keep things in balance. \r\n\n\n\nI have no other way to describe what I saw and felt at this moment other than absolute and complete serenity. I do not think I have ever been as happy in my life than at this moment. This feeling completely washed over me, and I finally let go of the Java Moss. The connection I had felt to the energy around me began to fade, but I could still sense it around me and whenever I watched the fish, it was immediately clear. \r\n\n\n\nI felt like I had been tripping on DMT for hours, but when I was finally able to look at the clock it was only 12:40! As the DMT wore off I could still tell I was tripping on mushrooms, but the visuals were almost completely gone. I spent the next hour and half just staring at the fish tank and watching the fish and Java Moss and thinking about what I had just experiences and my life as a whole.  I had thought that I have had some incredible experiences on psychedelics, but this was 1000 times better than anything. This extreme sense of serenity, peacefulness, and \u0093Oneness\u0094 persisted for the entire night, and through out the whole next day. \r\n\n\n\nTypically I am not one to believe in what some people may call the \u0093spirit world\u0094, and I\u0092m not sure that I do even know. But this experience was truly mind-altering. It was not something I ever expected before hand, and I don\u0092t know if I will every experience another trip like this one. There really is no way for me to explain what I saw and felt, and but my mind has been expanded in a way that I will never forget. My mind is still reeling from it all, and I am still struggling to make sense of it. But the more I think about, the more I feel that this was an opening into the energies of the Universe. This has been my one and only experience that I am confident in saying was a +4 by the Shulgin scale\r\n\n\n\nMay we all live happy, free, and with our minds wide open."

        "report_text": "Set:\r\n\nI  decided on a whim to consume a dose that had been prepared for my friend's girlfriend that, after speaking with my friend, she declined due to feeling unprepared for such an experience.  I had highly recommended that she not embark if she had any doubts as it could be unpleasant and I  felt morally obligated to protect her from such a decision.  I knew extracting the spice from the vessel would be difficult and exposure to air/light would cause it to degrade. And of course, I did not want any amount of the holy spice to go to waste.  I was feeling relaxed, did not have any negative feelings or thoughts in mind, and had experienced an approximately ~30mg dose earlier in the day that was quite pleasant.  I had eaten a bowl of Cheerios mixed with Honey Bunches of Oats approximately an hour earlier.\r\n\n\n\nSetting:\r\n\nMy living room at home with no light source other than my alarm clock.  I have always felt quite comfortable there and actually sleep on the couch on a regular basis.  As my friend was sitting on the couch 'recovering' from his first experience, I took a seat on the lazy boy.\r\n\n\n\nPreparation:\r\n\nAside from my experience earlier in the day, none.  I knew what I was getting in to (at least I thought I did) and as mentioned previously, the decision to embark was quite whimsical.\r\n\n\n\nOther substances:\r\n\n4mg Subutex (buprenorphine) taken sublingually approximately 15 hours previous - I take buprenorphine to help address the physiological portion of ongoing opiate dependence treatment.\r\n\n2mg Xanax (alprazolam) \u0096 1 mg taken with my buprenorphine, 1 mg taken 3 hours previous.  I take 1 mg every 12 hours as directed.   I was in a dose reduction stage of my opiate dependence treatment and the alprazolam helps with the associated anxiety that comes with opiate withdrawal/reduction.\r\n\nTHC - Residual amounts of THC due to semi-regular consumption of cannabis but I had not consumed any cannabis that day.\r\n\n\n\nApproximate time of dosage: 11:45PM\r\n\nI took what felt like a larger-than-normal hit from my hammerhead glass pipe Lightweaver (named after the Alex Grey painting which it closely resembles) and held it in as long as possible.  I exhaled and politely asked my friends to leave the room so I could trip in silence.  Those words had barely escaped my mouth when...\r\n\n\n\nT+0:01 : I was enveloped in an overwhelming sea of colorful geometry which resolved into a pathway leading to a very mechanical/alien-looking Mayan-themed pyramid.  I walked down the pathway and leaped up the stairway, leaping the steps in groups of 3 just as I would in real life, passing others on my way up.  I felt an overwhelming sense of pride when I reached the top of the stairway and was greeted by a doorway which led into a void.  \r\n\n\n\nI fearlessly stepped through the doorway and was greeted by a large 'being' which took the form of an N-dimensional (where N is greater than 3) unicursal hexagram.  (NOTE: I had seen this shape before and had to do a lot of Googling afterwards to find what it was called) Its 'skeleton' appeared to be made of light and an 'eye' at every vertex/intersection.  Every 'eye' was a copy of the being, repeating itself infinitely.  The being seemed somewhat annoyed by my demanding answers to the questions of why it was here, why I was here, and why the universe was here.  I recall a feeling of embarrassment/humility as I realized I was not prepared for the answer. The being responded 'You cannot learn the 29th lesson without learning the first 28' and pushed me backwards down the steps.  I began tumbling backwards and the pyramid took on a very sinister and dark quality.  I felt a sharp, very momentary pain in the center of my brain as this was happening.\r\n\n\n\nAt this point, I found myself in a 'cosmic emergency room' after tumbling backwards down the steps.  I use quotes because that's the best term I can use to describe it.  I was surrounded by 'nurses' of distinctly elfin appearance.  Humanoid, short, thin, with beautiful blue piercing eyes.  The younger nurses comforted me, 'said' this was a frequent occurrence and it was OK, while the 'head nurse' chided me for my arrogance.  Again, 'said' is completely proverbial - no words were ever exchanged.  It was as though these ideas were being communicated to me telepathically.  There were others in this cosmic ER that were in far worse condition than I and I recall the nurses who were attending to them making comments about how sad they were for the people the patients had left behind.  I am known to be a very empathetic person among my friends and co-workers and with the exception of the head nurse, there was an overwhelming feeling of empathy and cooperation in this place.\r\n\n\n\nT+??? -  After repairing/tending to my brain wound, the nurses signaled for a \u0093cosmic taxi mechanism\u0094.  It took quite some time for this mechanism to reach me and for my journey home to begin.  During that time, I conversed with the nurses about my experience and they said they had always wondered what was in the pyramid, but had always been too afraid to investigate due to the trauma they saw on a regular basis.\r\n\n\n\nWhen the red recliner machine arrived, the nurses bid me farewell and were quite kind... they appeared to gather in a crowd and multiply in number, all waving goodbye and wishing me well.\r\n\nT+0:15? - At this point, I was still experiencing rather strong effects.  I asked my friends what time it was as I could not see the clock that was 7 feet away from my face.\r\n\nT+0:20 - The effect was still rather strong, but it was more like an LSD or mushroom trip where I was conscious of my surroundings and they were merely \u0093altered\u0094.  I was fully conscious and could see the clock: 12:05am.  My friends had come back into the room and asked questions about my experience.  I was grateful that _I_ had taken the dose instead of my friend's girlfriend as I do not think she would have handled it well as a first-timer.  I believe I had consumed the dose I had prepared for her + a considerable amount of what my friend had left behind.  I did not have a proper scale to measure out the amounts and had 'measured' based on what a friend with a scale had shown me, so my 75mg dose estimate is purely hypothetical.  I have since obtained an accurate scale as to not make the same mistake.\r\n\n\n\nHaving read several other trip reports, my experience seems to have been very concrete and not as abstract as others'.  I remember the entire experience from beginning to end, as though it was a vivid dream.  The strange pain in the middle of my brain, where I have no nerves, was somewhat disconcerting and further research reveals this is in fact where my pineal gland is located.  I have always been skeptical of the connection between the pineal gland and DMT as there appears to be little peer-reviewed research linking the two.\r\n\n\n\nI have severe cognitive dissonance regarding the spice... a catch-22. On one hand, I feel everyone should experience DMT as it is incredible.  On the other hand, I feel empathy with those who created atomic weapons - it is so powerful and so potent that only the most responsible should possess it and anyone who WANTS to use it probably should not.  I had 4 experiences with the spice previously and none of them compared to this... the difference in experience was exponential.  \r\n\n\n\nOn the Shulgin scale, I would rate this at the +++ mark.  I was completely immersed in the experience and had my eyes open the entire time but did not regain my vision until the T+20 mark described above.  This is the closest I've ever had to a mystical/other-worldly experience and truthfully, I'm not sure I want to go back.  Much preparation will be required.\r\n\n\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for reading.  When relating this experience to friends, I was told that I was 'making shit up' and that 'it's never that vivid'.  I can only relate what I experienced in terms I know and if these terms seem unusual or unrealistic to readers, I apologize for my lack of a more concise vocabulary.  I'm not sure I'd believe it myself it it had not happened to me.  As I said, my previous experiences were nothing like this - they were far more abstract and could only be described in terms of feelings and emotions."

        "report_text": "The first thing I remembered is that I didn\u0092t remember anything. All I knew was a feeling of being in a dark nothingness, and I kept being pulled back down the road, to the street where I was born, but at the time I didn\u0092t know where it was, or where I was I just somehow felt a small familiarity here. I didn\u0092t know what had happened before this point, in-between, sideways, up, down or anywhere. I didn\u0092t even know who I was, or why I was here. I kept saying but I don\u0092t know where I am, I don\u0092t remember what I was doing, how can I get past this, they were turning my head to the side to look at this guy sitting next to me, I saw the face and still I said, but I don\u0092t know who he is. They danced me back to the nothingness then tried again, turned my head again to show me a small glimpse of the room I was in, you remember they kept saying, look again. They showed me the guy again, yes I remember I know him, but why, and how, and why am I here with him right now? They turned my head again to look down at the pipe, see, see, look, look. Look at it all, you remember now, and then I did, I remembered it was my friend sitting next to me and I\u0092d got to this point by smoking the pipe and that was what I had planned. \r\n\n\n\nIn this instant I looked at my friend and green hexadecimal shapes were vibrating in front of everything. I kept pulling myself back to where I was born and saying woah, this is too trippy but quickly they pulled me back to the room again and seemed to realise I was finding the whole thing nuts. They all worked together to help me, pulled me in again, pointed my senses to the music, follow what you know first and it will come, you\u0092ll see, you\u0092ll remember, you remember. Their voices danced away from me into the shapes and waves, bouncing in-between the shapes of the music. Yeah, but does it have to be so trippy, I said to them. Yes, because this is the way, this is the way you\u0091re coming. They kept pulling me towards them, saying follow what you know. I didn\u0092t realise at the time but Justice Phantom II, boys noize remix was playing, one of my favourite songs. So I latched onto the vibrations of the music, the ones that were visual, this is what I had to follow, the 4D projection that was dancing higher up into the corner of the ceiling, but as I focused too much, reality got in the way, I could see the wall and the piano and it was stopping me latching onto this thing that they were telling me about, I still didn\u0092t know what I was trying to get to, I just kept following their words, I said to them wait, can you show it to me clearer, no it\u0092s not clear enough, show me again but each time they did I still couldn\u0092t see it. They kept beckoning me upwards, on the wave of the music. Then things started to pull and stretch and it became impossible to try and contain it all to the point I had to pass through to get to the fourth dimension. Then they said, so you know now where you\u0092re going, you\u0092ve realised where you\u0092re going, the fourth dimension, so now you can come, now it will work, hypnotic voices in my head, always vibrating out to me in the green hexadecimal shapes, I laughed and my voice turned into the same green shapes and stepped out before me, following the beats of the music, leading me up to where they were telling me to go. \r\n\n\n\nAt this point probably 60 seconds had passed since I smoked the pipe.\r\n\n\n\nI started to realise that\u0092s where they were, in this place past reality that I now knew I could get to. I took control of the situation and told them all to help me, right you pull this part of that dimension, while I contain these parts, whilst also folding these bits\u0085 I had to focus hard and it kept slipping back but I quickly got it together again, then once it all came together and stayed, the music became louder, more fluent, pulling me towards it with the pulling vibrations. Travel on the song if its what you know, they kept saying, so I did, and towards the very point of reaching the fourth dimension, they actually appeared slightly out of the ceiling, from their dimension into mine to physically pull me out of it, They looked like matrix beings shaped by the same green hexadecimal shapes that seemed to be vibrating in time everywhere, their voices sounded like the song that was playing, and sometimes the speed of their words skipped over time, like time did not exist for them and time was being stretched upwards, towards them. I was getting to the point I needed to, all they kept saying was its okay, but you remember, but you remember, but you remember, this is the way, it\u0091s all okay. \r\n\n\n\nThen quicker than light they pulled me right out, like I was being shot out of the matrix, there was no music, no time, no room, I was suddenly in the ether, the void, the whole place in-between and outside everything at once, the place you come from and the place you go to at the very beginning and end of life. The ones who had been helping me get there now glowed pale white and came towards me on beams of lights and they said to me immediately, so you see, you remember now, this is all it is, this is where you were coming. Now you see, now you see. And somehow I knew they were right, I\u0092d been here before, at the beginning and end of everything. They were flying up to me, every time I asked a question in my head, but what about \u0085 but what about\u0085 before I even had a chance to finish the thought in my head, they would show me the answer, they flicked their hand and turned my face to look into a small ball of swirling matter, when I glanced, I saw for a fleeting moment the answer to any question I had started to ask, and every time they would say, but you knew that already, but you remember, but you know that, see, see, see, sometimes they would dance, back on the green hexadecimal vibrations to show me it was happy and safe. So you see, the way you came in, this is what this is about, this is what people see when they come here and this is all it is. No fear ever crossed my mind, just wonder, just curiosity, just kept saying but yeah what about this though, what about that, what about the space time continuum, and they would show me in a second, but you just crush the time and stretch the space and add the senses and look, look, look, they sang and danced again as I started to understand each little bit more. \r\n\n\n\nThey gave it to me in bits at my pace, they knew how much to give, how much to show, they knew that I was getting there, always kept answering my questions with the fleeting swirling ball that they would flick in front of you and always they would sing after it, but you already knew that, you knew that, now do you remember, so now do you remember? It was like a song, like everything was happening at the right time, at the right pace, at the right rate, I got it all, and they said so you have no more questions to ask, because you see it all, now you remember, you understand again. But I still had a question - but why don\u0092t we all get to see this all the time? Because they said, and showed me how when the space and time is crushed into our reality, this thought can\u0092t happen there, they showed me how everything has to be at a point for our reality to exist, and that it is really our self in the ether, the one that dreams, our consciousness that creates it all, this is what creates your reality, this is you, your own creator, you are here, always, you always have been and always will be, this is how it is all safe and good, this is how you do it, they showed me how and it was like my reality that I\u0092d left behind was a picture being projected from me, myself, in this dimension. I said to myself, just like a hologram, and they danced again, yes, yes, but you knew that already. Yes, cos I had read it about three months ago and even when I\u0092d read it I knew that although I didn\u0092t completely understand it that it was somehow still right. I was asking them things like yeah but why do I write creative stories and woosh they would show me a fleeting glimpse and I would go, oh yeah, each time cos I already knew. \r\n\n\n\nThen I asked them about personal questions about people, about love, about hurt, about them and me, what did it mean, but they crushed it quickly, no, you remember, that doesn\u0092t work here, those thoughts can\u0092t manifest here, it\u0092s emotions and they don\u0092t work here, that\u0092s not what this is for, they exist in the hologram but they can\u0092t be thought here. And as soon as they said it I remembered again that they were right. It wasn\u0092t void of emotions in a bad way, only that they were a different thing that belonged in the hologram, the old reality, that is where the strong emotions I was trying to project have to stay. They simply don\u0092t work in the fourth dimension. That is why, they pointed to the whole world, from beginning to end in one swift movement I saw it all evolve along with the power of emotion as a projection from our inner beings. That is why, they said, the why for everything, it all links in to the whys of the world, why war, why money, why pain, why love - emotion, it is created there but not here in the fourth dimension, that is the result if you like for that particular squashing of the time and space and the senses, and that\u0092s the why for all your emotion questions, think about them when you go back, they told me, you cant take them into this dimension to think about, it just doesn\u0092t work, just like you cant take things out of this one, they just cant be thought in your old reality. Its all your creation, it\u0092s all your choice, it\u0092s all your projection, it\u0092s where you take yourself... But remember\u0085 you knew that already.\r\n\n\n\nI was laughing because of the amount of times they had said this to me, and still it was just beginning to sink in. I said to them, what ever I ask you here, you\u0092re gonna show me but as soon as you do, I will realise that I knew it anyway, I had just forgotten, so there is no point in asking any more. (But I still asked what the other dimensions looked like, just out of interest) They quickly showed me, look, its just this and this and this, they pulled the space out, they crushed the time in then made it linear, they pulled the senses apart and together, the senses that were created when the space-time were at the right point, they showed me the projection and where that would go, reality, life as we see it out of this fourth dimension, and this is all it is, look, they showed me the other dimensions, tiny dimensions, ones that were so miniscule we zoomed in and in on them until they became clear. They showed me that it was nothing difficult to understand, that it was all just layers and different ways of doing them, and this is the layer you are doing just now, my reality was just this part of the everything that always happened, that after it, here I would come again, they quickly showed me beams of light that I felt I could choose to go to. They had different paths and choices and places down them but right now I was not going near them, this was for after, this is where you will come to choose where to go next, when your current reality ends, when your hologram world stops. But why don\u0092t we get to know this, think how beautiful it would be for everyone, But no, they quickly showed me, but you know why, look, and I saw the reasons why it couldn\u0092t be, it just wouldn\u0092t work, the dimensions have to be this way, the hologram has to work that way, this is the way it was and always has and continues to be. And some people\u0092s reality have become too real, it\u0092s too dangerous for them to know. \r\n\n\n\nNow you remember, they kept saying again, and finally I said yeah, now I know, now I know everything, and they danced again, and we both knew it was near the end, so you see, you\u0092ve done it, they reassured me as they prepared me to go back into my old reality, they turned me towards a tiny window, inside which all the space-time was focused, the tiny window of my old reality that they were now guiding me back to. This is all it was about, that\u0092s it now, you\u0092ve done it, you\u0092ve saw it, you\u0092ve came and this is the only reason you came here, to find out, to be shown, in your own way, what this all means. They started to dance me back to my reality and I saw small flickers of the living room, and I knew they were letting me go back to it cos it was time, this was over cos I had achieved what I came to do. \r\n\n\n\nBut I held onto it. I said but wait what did you tell me at the very beginning, and what was the space time continuum again, and how exactly did this work again, it was like as I was falling back in to old reality I was letting slip this fourth dimension. But you know, they kept saying, more softly now, its all okay, but you know you can\u0092t carry all the knowledge back, it doesn\u0092t work remember, some things can only be understood in this fourth dimension, some things will slip out your memory cos you know it cant exist in the dimension that you\u0092re going back to, the hologram, the thought, the creation of your being, the creation of your mind, being, soul, your everything. They kept putting me back in gently even though I wanted to remember as much as I could, they gently took the small things back that couldn\u0092t exist in the old reality but left me with the knowledge I had understood them and always will but cannot describe them fully back in my old reality, not even in my mind, especially if I think too hard about it. But if I let it go and flow back to the fourth dimension, I feel that small glimpse again, I don\u0092t see the answer but I feel it, in my whole being and the answer is - you already know the answer. When I started to feel the reality of the room more and started to leave the fourth dimension altogether I felt sick and told them oh yuk I don\u0092t like this part, you never said this would happen, I mean you told me the answers to the universe but you never told me about this part! But they just made me look at the empty bottle of Bucky then made me feel the sickness again and made me see it was because I drank the Bucky, well what did you expect, they seemed to be telling me. I still didn\u0092t like it so they showed me quickly all that it was, look its just your physical self trying to reattach to your thought projection, your senses trying to find their way back together, I mean come on your squashing space and time back together here and its gonna feel a little weird. Of course I knew exactly what they were talking about (cos I was now all knowing in that area) so once I understood it, the sicky effect started to fade. They told me to follow what I knew again and danced me back in on the music which was now on My Moon, My Man, boys noize remix.\r\n\n\n\nI had a play list playing so I now know that only about 12 minutes had passed but at that moment, time was still skewed so I couldn\u0091t really tell. They showed me how to latch onto the music again, the same way I had done when I was coming in. And so I listened to the music and lay for a long time half in the fourth dimension and half in the reality, aware that they were still taking care of me. I was still able to hold the time, and make the song stop while thinking in my head for long minutes before the next beat of the song came in again. You have to let time fall back to where it should be, they said. But I like being able to do this, I told them, even though I knew I couldn\u0092t possibly exist properly in this reality if I was constantly bending time. Look, they said and suddenly I could hear my friend breathing, I hadn\u0091t even been aware that he was still there, he is worried about you, stop getting lost in the space time continuum, stop playing about with it, you know it\u0092s time to go back. I knew that most people who take DMT last no more than 20 minutes but I had been out of it for nearly an hour so understandably my friend was worrying, but I was fully able to come back into the room, I just didn\u0092t want to stop playing with the space-time continuum just yet. I was in my element, being able to stop time and send my mind back to their dimension to daydream for as long as I wanted about everything they\u0091d just showed me, then pull my mind back into the room and start up time again. But once they\u0092d made me realise my friend would worry if I lay there all night bending time, I agreed with them it was time to come back. \r\n\n\n\nGently they kept pushing me further back into the old reality, until it got to a point where I was aware of being more in the old reality than I was in their fourth dimension and that\u0092s when they finally let go, once they knew I was safely back in the room, along with a slight tinge of sadness at leaving them behind. I heard my friend speak and the sound of a voice made the reality stronger so I just focused on the textures, smells, sounds, and sights bit by bit until I could put them all back together again, it took longer than I had been told it would take, but probably because I had clouded my head with alcohol. I laughed about the fact they had kept telling me you remember, you remember it all, see you already knew that, as if you were going to be told something you didn\u0092t already know, it was the ultimate non mystery but in the same sense the ultimate mystery. It was everything and nothing, it was knowing and not knowing, remembering and forgetting, forgetting and remembering. Everything, here it is, here it always is, and always will be, here is life, this part of it anyway. \r\n\n\n\nThat\u0092s what they were there for, like some sort of guardians of the gateway, they were glowing beings like people but who flew at you on beams of light, with glowing crowns on their heads. They showed me everything, they were the ones who had guided me in and gently guided me back out, they were only there to do this, they knew I was coming in, they knew when I would be going out, they knew how to help me, they knew what to say to me, they knew exactly who I was, had been, and would still be. After about an hour of nonsense ramblings to my friend I tried to make sense of it all again, in the squashed time-space dimension and knew it was hard, basically impossible but still, I remembered what they\u0092d said about only being able to know some things in that fourth dimension, accepting that again, remembering everything again, learning it all again, laughing and laughing because I had already knew it all, just like they had told me, you remember you have done all this before, you\u0092ve came in before, you\u0092ve gone out, your being will never forget, as soon as you see it all again, you remember, now go back, take it with you, hold it close, because not many know, not many can see, because that\u0092s just the way it is. But you knew that already"

        "report_text": "I've been interested in DMT for a long time and have been using it almost as long as I've been using psychoactives in general, but I've never been able to get quite what I felt should be for a long time. Not until now, that is.\r\n\n\n\nIn the past I have had both weak and strongly visual sub-breakthrough experiences, but nothing more than that. Low doses made me sedated and gave me typical psychedelic visuals; colored grids, melting and colorful walls, swirling shapes, and so on. The higher doses made me body anesthetized but my mind was quite stimulated; visuals were heavily kaleidoscopic in nature, bursting with vibrant colors, and included a lot of entity content that seemed separate from myself. That is to say that these entities did not seem to be a part of my consciousness or based on it in any way, they were simply beings I was perceiving. I did not directly interact with any of them for these experiences.\r\n\n\n\nIt has been a long time since those trips and a lot of things have changed both about who I am and about how psychoactives work on me. I used to take high doses of many different hallucinogens often and after a while it got to a point where psychedelics no longer seem to give me significant visual effects, at least in the typical sensory patterns way. They started becoming more like chaotic, neon dissociatives to me. Even for one of my last significant trips until now, a very large dose of LSD which was three and a half years ago, there were no kaleidoscopes or very many fractals or much at all in that respect. It was just a very powerful and bizarre out-of-body experience that focused on realistic dream perceptions but in very unrealistic ways, things like entity contact and breaking the laws of physics but in my actual house.\r\n\n\n\nOver the past week or so I have been smoking DMT a lot in an attempt to bring myself back up into psychedelic use slowly. I only intended to ever use it in sub-breakthrough doses still just to see where I am. These experiences verified that even after all this time, psychedelics still tend to be more like dissociatives for me. Things like distortions in perception of my body size and a heavy distancing from the experience were prevalent. Visuals consisted of very little besides the room breathing in a way that caused it to break into multiple layers, like quadruple vision or more, and it was clear that this was largely related to a pattern of colorful, grainy static that would overtake my field of vision after I dosed. It really was just like visual snow but with some visible curves in it, and not much else. It was also very transparent even when it was quite strong for what it is.\r\n\n\n\nTwo nights ago I decided that I wanted to push myself further than I had gone so far. I knew that the DMT that I have this time is good because I've already used it to dose friends of mine, including one into a breakthrough, with less than the doses I was using and my same smoking technique. Based on past experiences with DMT and just with psychedelics in general, I have to assume that I'm just not a lightweight for it. I'm planning to get a GVG soon for future use to conserve as much of my supply as possible. But for now I was just ready to experience more, so I used my usual technique of sandwiching it between inactive doses of an herb, in this case catnip, but this time put two separate, full layers of DMT in it. I waited until late at night when I was otherwise headed to bed, turned out all the lights in my room, and then took a number of good-sized hits from it, how many hits exactly I can't quite recall.\r\n\n\n\nThe first thing I remember from the trip is feeling like my consciousness was at the center of some kind of nebula with a white center, which I'm noticing more and more on DMT. This isn't exactly the way I thought of it at the time, it's just the only way I can think to describe it now. The layers of visual snow had increased to an extremely heavy point; I was now perceiving what seemed to be a huge mesh of concepts shoved into the same big picture. All of these involved very vivid hallucinations of entities and objects, but none of them was 'complete'. The best way I can describe it is that if you have a bunch of frames of chaotic images all stack on top of each other from bottom to top by order of decreasing proportion you would only see the very edges of each one, and that's what my frame of view was. All of those images were also dynamic and constantly changing from one moment to the next, and though I couldn't see a full view of any of them I had a strong sense of what each clip of the madness that I was seeing was.\r\n\n\n\nThese hallucinations, like in my past trips, felt distinctly separate from me. They were more like visions I was seeing as opposed to actual distortions in my consciousness. However, unlike before, they did seem to draw heavily from my subconscious. During the peak of this experience I recalled previously long lost memories from the high dose LSD trip I mentioned before. As strong psychedelic hallucinations generally do for me, these perceptions all felt incredibly erotic. However, my overall feeling could not have been even remotely described as euphoric. As the trip was first starting to sink in I felt that I understood the feeling people described of having an elephant sitting on your chest. Until this point I had actually had a lot of reservations about pushing too far because over the years I had become quite a hypochondriac and feared that I had damaged my body quite a bit by my past rampant drug use, and those fears definitely manifested here. With all these sensations combined, I became convinced that I was dying and had the typical feelings of knowing that my loved ones will be so disappointed, I've lost out on so much life, and such things that are repeated ad infinitum throughout the psychedelic experience in general. These were, however, brand new thoughts for me; no psychoactive has been able to take me nearly this far out before.\r\n\n\n\nAt some point during the experience, though I believe those death spots still existed somewhere in the background of the nebula, the hallucinations became much more prevalent than the psychological aspect. I simply basked in the absurdity of it all for a little while, and then out of nowhere it suddenly occurred to me that I still had a body. At that moment my panicky side kicked in and I was compelled to do my usual vitals checks. I noticed that my body felt weird and sweaty, as it has in the past with DMT when I became nervous, but these things suddenly seemed so inconsequential compared to what I had just experienced. It basically felt that by the time it even occurred to me to monitor myself I already knew that I was coming down, so the things that normally worry me didn't seem important. I was struck with a strong thirst and so I tried to reach behind me to the headboard of the bed to grab a water bottle, but in the darkness I was far too disoriented. My nebulous vision didn't change regardless of which way I faced, and my spatial perception was absolutely destroyed. It felt as though everything that I knew should be right around me could easily exist in any and every direction at any moment, and trying to feel things out only verified this. After hearing myself knock a couple of things over, I stopped trying and just plopped back down to rest.\r\n\n\n\nNot long after that I felt down enough to reach up and turn the light on properly, so I did so and was faced with several transparent copies of my bedroom all floating around each other and breathing all as one. At this point the only thing going through my head was how happy I was to be alive, and I started laughing and clutching the bed. That was about the extent of the hallucinogenic experience, but the psychological effects lasted for quite some time after that, as did residual stimulation. There was no way I was going straight to bed after that. I felt incredible, not just because I had actually reached a level of experience that I was trying to for so long but because this trip proved that my fears about pushing further on DMT were unfounded. Despite my insecurities about my body health and what I believed to be happening during the trip, I came out of it perfectly fine. So many of my fears were extinguished from that moment onward.\r\n\n\n\nA few hours later I was still awake and on my computer. I realized that there might still be some DMT left in the bowl I had smoked earlier since I put so much in it, so I figured hey, no fear! I picked it up and took the rest of what was in there in a couple of decent hits. This experience was completely different in every way. I still felt a slightly uncomfortable kind of body energy, but overall I was actually quite euphoric. I was getting hypnagogic visions like I never have before. Again, there were no basic psychedelic sensory distortions such as kaleidoscopes or fractals, but I was getting vivid warping scenery. It started with sort of a view of looking down upon a city in the sky; I saw a building slowly and smoothly rise into existence out of the ground and then some trees began to form on either side of it. People, way out of proportion to the rest of the scene, then began to form on either side of the trees and the middle of the image began transforming into a bizarre alien spaceship full of neon colors. These visions were all transparent but very detailed, and the gentle and smokey way they formed gave me the feeling that the DMT was just playfully stroking my mind, sort of like a lover, as this was again all very erotic to me. Despite this, these visions still felt like they existed as the place I was at rather than as a part of me. There was a decent amount of dissociation for this as well and sometimes it felt difficult to tell where reality ended and the trip began. I felt ecstatic and simply rolled around until it wore off, when I then got back on my laptop. The last thing I noticed about this was that I was getting fully 3D versions of my weak psychedelic visuals; even though it was just tracers and breathing and the like, they looked more integrated into my reality than they have from any psychedelic in years.\r\n\n\n\nI finally went to bed after that, and I spent all of yesterday very excited about my experiences. I reflected a lot on those trips and re-evaluated how I treat psychedelics. I felt a lot of freedom after letting go of the fear of pushing myself further. I had also started to worry that I wouldn't be able to get much out of psychedelics anymore because of how my trips had been progressing, and I now felt convinced otherwise. I wanted to dose again last night, but I was so tired from work after I got home that I quickly passed out not long after getting in bed. I woke up around 4 AM and decided that it was as good a time as any to trip, so I loaded myself a bowl. I used the method I had been using before, only putting one layer in, to see if those experiences would have changed my sensitivity to it at all, but they didn't seem to. Without typical psychedelic visuals to speak of, low doses don't amount to much more than confusing dissociative states for me, especially after what I had just gone through. I went to bed just after that and slept for a few more hours.\r\n\n\n\nWhen I awoke, I decided that I was going to give it one more shot before starting my day. This time I loaded myself another double-layered bowl and tried to get as comfortable as possible. After a minute or two of mental preparation, I picked up the pipe and took two big hits, which amounted to more than two draws because I pulled so much smoke from them. I think this may have been my strongest experience yet; it's only because of a subsequent dose that I even remember how it started, which was with the typical visual snow field but extremely intensely. I was once again brought back to the nebula, only this time I was so deep in the light that I can't recall anything else from it. If there were hallucinations at all, I was far too dissociated to process or remember them. The first thing that I can recall is being filled with feelings of guilt. This centered around my body feeling quite uncomfortable, which I don't think I could actually perceive at all at the time, but I was somehow still aware of it, perhaps through its psychological implications. This trip has really got me thinking about how just because you're too far apart from your body to feel it doesn't necessarily mean it won't be influencing what you're experiencing in any way; the mind-body connection exists even if you don't realize it. Back to the trip, it was occurring to me that just because I had abandoned the fear I felt before it didn't mean that I didn't still need to get my act together. I've stopped taking every drug that comes my way, but I still abuse my body and don't live nearly as a healthy a life as my should, even enough to let my body heal from the things that have worried so much in the past. In my previous dose I had still been on an incredible high from my death experience and that probably facilitated what was such a beautiful trip, but now that it was a new day I had to remember that I still had responsibilities to take care of in life. Only once I integrate this lesson will I truly be able to return to tripping comfortably.\r\n\n\n\nBefore I go on to this next part, let me just say that I consider myself to be a very physical person. There is a very strong link between the way I feel physically and the way I feel emotionally and psychologically, and vice-versa. In fact, the more I tripped in the past and my visual experiences started becoming weaker the more my physical experiences started becoming stronger, which may have been connected to how I started worrying about my body in the first place since I wasn't treating it well. After I stopped using strong hallucinogens for a long time I actually grew to love cannabis so much because of just how physical of a psychedelic it can be. It was through using it that I became so in touch with my body, and this is part of why the mind-body connection I mentioned before means so much to me, particularly in the context of these DMT trips. I've actually only experienced synesthesia a couple of times before in my life, once on a psychedelic and once on a deliriant, and each of those was based around my body feelings bleeding into my other senses. The former involved squeezing the bed I was lying on and then releasing it, and as I did the visual patterns I was seeing behind closed eyes, back when visuals were common for me, compressed and then released along with my fingers and had a bouncing sound effect along with it. The latter involved a static pattern on the wall which would only move or change even slightly as I reoriented myself and changed which direction I was looking at it from. These experiences only strengthen my belief that my body plays a large role in my perception.\r\n\n\n\nAnyway, not too long after I had those thoughts I mentioned before I felt myself sliding back out of the nebula, but slowly. The first significant thing that happened was that my body reintegrated into my sensory awareness. At this point, as far as I can remember, there were still no significant visuals or hallucinations to speak of, maybe just some little grainy flakes of color floating around the white light at best. However, that all changed quickly. For the first time since I dosed I felt myself breath in, and the second I did my reality began to warp possibly more strongly than it ever has before. It twisted into humanoid shapes that were extremely well-defined despite being based on this nebulous lack of visuals, it was essentially an unbelievably heavy distortion of current sensory information rather than being an explosion of new sensations. As I breathed back out, these humanoid forms twisted in a different way that was just as mind-blowing. When I breathed back in they returned to their original design, and then went back again as I released my breath. This was pure synesthesia of an incredibly high caliber. Though I still felt uncomfortable as I was earlier, this experience nearly made up for it with how amazing and erotic it was. This is why I've been mentioning how the entities and visions that I've always seen on DMT previously seemed like separate things from me. These humanoid forms were entirely different from what I've experienced before. These figures were my body, my breath, my life. They were intrinsically me and I was intrinsically them. I felt them as a part of myself just as I feel any other part of my body, and this sensation was overwhelming. It was the kind of thing I had always dreamed of experiencing on any psychoactive, but especially a psychedelic. It was absolutely breathtaking, and something that stood out to me more than anything was how much it differed from the typical identity loss kind of psychedelic effects. It was truly all about me.\r\n\n\n\nAs this experience was already on the comedown, it wasn't long after that that I returned to the typical multiple breathing copies of my room and not much else other than a sense of awe. I couldn't stop thinking about what I had just gone through. At first I wondered, how could the comedown have possibly been so much more hallucinogenic than the peak? Even though I can't recall if there were hallucinations as I was peaking, I feel that I can say with absolutely certainty that nothing like that was happening. However, upon thinking more about the mind-body connection, I began to wonder. My emotional and psychological state may be affected by my body even if I can't feel it, but it makes perfect sense that an experience such as synesthesia wouldn't begin until it actually entered my conscious awareness. This gave me a lot to think about and it's still doing so. About half an hour after that dose, I smoked the rest of the DMT that was in my pipe thinking that there probably wasn't a lot left. That was the subsequent dose I mentioned that was the only reason I even remembered how the previous trip started. It didn't amount to much aside from the visual snow pattern though, and that was my last experience so far.\r\n\n\n\nSo, to recap, these are the responsibilities in my life that I need to see through that I have taken away from these trips, in order:\r\n\n\n\n1. I need to get a GVG and a scale. If it's going to take me more than the average person to get a potent effect out of DMT then I want to make sure that what I have lasts as long as possible. Especially considering that I'm sharing what I have with people as well, every milligram counts.\r\n\n\n\n2. I need to remember to let go of fear. The value of experiencing something truly terrifying like this is that it paves the way for something truly beautiful. I've made bad decisions in the past, but I can overcome them like anything else if I just have faith in myself. In addition, simply being able to dive into the deep end without reservations is obviously how I'm going to see the truly mystical side of life.\r\n\n\n\n3. I need to remember to stick to my goals; just because I've made some progress doesn't mean I can get carried away again. I've worked a lot on my psychological issues, but I still have physical issues to overcome as well that are at least as important if not more so. If I ever want a chance at a better life, I need to work on all of my problems, not just some of them.\r\n\n\n\n4. After I've fully integrated and completely resolved the previous two responsibilities, I need to find the perfect dose of oral DMT to get me back to that place of synesthesia for a decent amount of time and then have incredible sex on it. There is no other option.\r\n\n\n\nSo that's where I am right now. That last one is a little less serious of course, not that I'm not completely committed to it, but I really am seriously interested in oral DMT now as well. I'm also more excited than ever to push toward a full breakthrough. The first and third major trips I mentioned here were obviously on sort of a different level of experience, but the second one was absolutely the kind of thing that I know could have become the typical breakthrough with entity contact and dream scenes that I hear so much about if I had dosed higher. But of course, I need to make sure I'm ready for that kind of experience first as well. In the end, these trips have just given me a lot to reflect on, accomplish, and prepare myself for in the future. In order, I would have to say that these trips were probably the strongest psychological, strongest visual, and strongest synesthetic experiences I've ever had, and not to mention some of the most helpful.\r\n\n\n\nThe final thought I would have to add to this is that I am certainly interested in seeing much more of what DMT has to show me!"

        "report_text": "This was a trip report I wrote for my friends, and I'm passsing it on now to the Nexus:\r\n\n\n\nWhat do I mean by exhaling into the universe?\r\n\n\n\nLiterally exhaling my mind, soul, and body into and throughout the universe.\r\n\n\n\nI had my first breakthrough on DMT. I had gotten a gram of it and have had countless experiences of what most would call intense visuals and mind trips for my personal self and I've also experienced the gift of giving and sharing these experiences with others amongst me.\r\n\n\n\nI mostly did what I called 'microdosing', meaning I and others would continuously consume only enough to have a layer of the energy, peace, beauty, and serenity of DMT take over our body and ambiance and surroundings for as long as felt right (30 minutes to an hour usually); mind you a full blown spice trip lasts about 10 minutes. Those moments shared are unparalleled by anything else you could experience when in the right mindset with the right friends and mentality. The room we're in and the current reality becomes engulfed in textures and fractals that dance all around us; colors and shapes take over; everything in the universe feels ok and at peace; everything is just beautiful and we're sharing this moment with a friend or two.\r\n\n\n\nDoing this alone eventually got boring and uninteresting at one point, honestly. I could have my whole room transforming and come out to me, but I was completely indifferent to it; I was unaffected and unphased emotionally; I just felt nothing, didn't care, and just wanted it to go away because it was just irrelevant in a way. DMT had lost its magic.\r\n\n\n\nMy wish, however, was to have at least one true breakthough for my last remaining dose of the gram because I wanted to experience Deemster to its full potential.\r\n\n\n\nLast night at 3:00 AM, I decided to have a session with 4 friends and finish off my last bits of DMT from the gram I had gotten. I didn't have much left and I knew my chance of having a final breakthrough wasn't going to happen but giving others the opportunity to try this substance is something I take great pride in. The plan was to microdose so everyone could get the chance to experience and enjoy the visuals and beauty of spice. These are people that have only smoke weed in the past; they're jumping from just weed to the absolute most powerful psychedelic in the world. It's quite the jump, but it's also why I do this microdosing technique, so others aren't overwhelmed by its effect, though it's hard to avoid that scary sensation when you've never experienced anything close to it. We had a couple couches and all the lights off with a large, orange lava lamp in the center, giving the room a deep glow and aura. The atmosphere was created by a very serene and calm nature sound track that greatly adds to the ambience.\r\n\n\n\nOut of the four friends there, two enjoyed multiple microtrips; very beautiful, under control in the sense that they weren't panicking, and just an all around great experience for them for the night. One other friend supposedly didn't feel anything. I think it's fear of the substance's power and a mental block that didn't let him achieve any more than a slight sensation. He often refused to keep dosing and tried to avoid any further hits for the night, but then came back to it and then quit again. I sense fear, but only that person knows what's going on in them. My last friend, the most wacky one, begged for more and more as he heard of my microdose and the others' experiences during the night; he ended up experiencing more than he bargained for. His night ended quite intensely from what it seemed; he refused to tell us exactly what happened, but he insisted he was ok. He dosed, tripped, and then laid shedding tears for the rest of the night.\r\n\n\n\nAfter one beautiful microdose trip, and the pipe going around again, I took the last heavy hit of the night, though the bowl had already been lit previously twice by those before. Here's the beauty of DMT, if one wants to perceive it this way. It can surprise me when I least expect it. Dose size doesn't really always matter; a 30mg trip can be as powerful as a 100mg trip.\r\n\n\n\nAnd that's how it happened.\r\n\n\n\nMy wish was fulfilled.\r\n\n\n\nAs I held my inhalation, I could tell there was something different about it this time; something more intense, further than just the layer of visuals that usually consume me. The tight, drowning sensation in my lungs and chest from holding my breath for so long sank away; I don't remember exhaling the hit.\r\n\n\n\nMy body tingled. It began to vibrate. It became as light as ever. It was like a rush of wind and air flowed through me and then it just ripped me out of my body; I could literally feel myself fall and fly out of my physical. Someone in the room in this reality asked, 'Did you break through?' and I scoffed mockingly and asked myself as if it were a stupid question 'Did I break through? Did I break through?' Haha...there was an internal acceptance to the answer: no words, but a yes...a very clear yes. I had been waiting for this for so long; I had been so eager, yet so fearful to come this far and here I was. I started saying, 'This is it! This is it!'\r\n\n\n\nThat's when all this reality, this humanity, this earth, everything as we know now, did not exist any further. I was taken away completely and absolutely from this existence. I had no eyes; no open eyes, no closed eyes, no nothing. My vision was completely consumed. What I saw, was as real as the computer screen you're looking at right now.\r\n\n\n\nI was put into an infinitely tall room that was all black and white in the pattern of a checker board with this creature staring at directly into my eyes. It was a reptilian-like life with a tail and very big eyes, inches from my face, looking at me with a very devilish smile; it was almost invisible, looking nearly perfectly camouflaged with the black and white checkerboard surrounding. As it looked at me, I don't know if it was the one that asked me, or if it was an internal question coming from me, but something asked, 'Are you happy? Are you happy now?' In other words, was I satisfied with what a breakthrough was? Was I satisfied that I finally had a breakthrough? I said, 'Yes...yes, I'm always happy' and that was one of those key moments in that, when I said I'm always happy, I meant it in that I always want to be happy; we should always be happy; life is meant to be enjoyed and to be happy; I see myself as a happy person and I'm seen as a happy person from many people and I want to be that happy person.\r\n\n\n\nI looked down the checkerboard pathway and was in total shock and awe. I released a slow, deep, serene, airy, and god-like voice that just said 'Whoa...' There is no way to express the feeling of realizing what's going on and there is no more adequate situation to genuinely mean and use the word whoa.\r\n\n\n\nHowever, this is when fear took over. An intense, deep, and genuine fear when I realized that I had absolutely no control over what's happening; a fear I've never felt before. It registered that I was taken away from reality; I was in shock and I wanted to come back. I was scared...very. I fought back with this other reality to come back to this reality, so I somehow managed to stand up from the couch; to keep some kind of sense with Earth. I managed to get up and that's when one of the most intense things that's ever happened to me occurred.\r\n\n\n\nI stood up, I looked down at the floor and there was nothing. There was nothing below me. There was nothing above me. There was nothing around me. No ground, no floor, no ceiling, nothing. I was floating in a dark, vast place of infinite dimensions.\r\n\n\n\nI was floating in the center of the universe.\r\n\n\n\nThinking about this now and writing about it instills an uneasiness about me.\r\n\n\n\nThough there was no physical me, I looked around, raised my arms by my sides and took in the absolute most profound deep breath one could ever take; I didn't have a diaphragm; a breath so deep, so replenishing, so clean, so pure, so ravishing through my whole body, that it went beyond being any physical breath I could ever take. It cleared my physical being, I could feel the rush of it through my back. The air was rushing through nothingness, but through me. I'm not religious, nor do I believe much in God, but the best way to put is: this inhalation was as if God had breathed in through me.\r\n\n\n\nAnd with inhalation comes exhalation...Exhaling into the universe.\r\n\n\n\nI wish I could convey this exhale.\r\n\n\n\nI wish I could explain what it felt like.\r\n\n\n\nI wish everyone could see and understand what it was like.\r\n\n\n\nI dropped my arms and the breath released me. It cleaned me. It echoed through me and through the universe forever. It filled the vastness around me. A breath so powerful I could blow the earth and this solar system across the universe. The breath was almost mechanical. It sounded unreal. It is a sound that could never be recreated nor could it ever be possible to hear on this earth or this reality.\r\n\n\n\nI would've done this forever, but with each breath there was an intense and profound fear. It was as if a God was in my body performing these actions for me. With each breath, I wasn't sure I would be ok, in a sense. With each breath, I was reminded the vastness I was floating in. With each breath, I was reminded of the infinite and overwhelming power I was consumed in.\r\n\n\n\nMy fear throughout this trip, my wanting to stay in this reality, kept me grounded after these breaths. I walked to my room, still in another reality practically, and I stood at the doorway where the source of the beautiful ambient music was playing. My room was not my room; there was a blue hue and tint over everything and there were no singular objects that were recognizable. I stood at the doorway and I can't remember much at this point, because it was just my mind racing at a thousand miles an hour. I remember experiencing an extremely intense sense of happiness. A happiness beyond any ecstasy I've taken. I finally broke and started bawling tears. I grabbed my face, I put my hands in my mouth, I grabbed my body, I felt it, I embraced it fully. I couldn't believe everything that had just happened.\r\n\n\n\nIt felt like a rebirth.\r\n\n\n\nAfter standing at the door way for some time, not really remembering much of what happened there, I walked back to the living room where my four friends had all been watching me the entire time. I sat down in the chair, I calmed down, and took it all in. There were images and faces dancing on the carpet floor that relaxed me. I was dripping in sweat and tears. I felt like I had just gone on the most intense emotional roller coaster, like I was just thrown across the universe, and now I was back. I was recollecting myself.\r\n\n\n\nI couldn't grasp the idea of everything I had just seen, everything that had just happened. There was just no way. There's no way. There is no way.\r\n\n\n\nEverything I had just experienced was beyond anything my mind could even imagine. I had certain images stuck in my head that would bring back tears in an instant. I wanted everyone to know, to understand, what it was that I saw. I want everyone now to know and understand what I saw because it is just so inconceivable.\r\n\n\n\nI began apologizing to all my friends for exposing them to this insanity, for having to see me in such a maniacal state of mind and behavior, but I thought, somehow, that it was right and for the best that they saw it. They got to observe someone go through a breakthrough, they got to see what DMT can truly do and that's what most people can't do: respect this substance. It is something so intense that I can't just jump into and I can't really prepare for it in any way, no matter how much drug experience I had.\r\n\n\n\nNow that I've gotten to this stage, it's not something I'll do for fun. After this breakthrough, I don't know if I'll ever go back to this alternate reality. Every DMT trip I've ever done pales in comparison to this breakthrough.\r\n\n\n\nI could not fathom the power of this hallucinogenic until I experienced it. It is an experience so profound it kept me thinking about it for days, and thinking about it brings me back.\r\n\n\n\nI ended the night at 7:30 AM with a roommate of mine, microdosing whatever resin was left in the pipe of DMT and tree. It was a very surreal experience with him and we just spoke about our trips and of other trippy things, like our existence, how we're connected, etc.\r\n\n\n\nIt was one of the most intense nights of my life.\r\n\n\n\nIf you're reading this, it's because I believe you're beyond the average person and will have a deeper appreciation for it and have a further understanding of the mind. I think most of you should get the chance to experience it once in your life. It's one of those things that's scary and one probably wouldn't do again but is extremely grateful for having experienced it and would never trade it back for anything.\r\n\n\n\nMuch love and peace to all.\r\n\n\n\nPeace. Love. Unity. Respect.\r\n\n\n\nP.L.U.R."

        "report_text": "I've tried most common psychedelics extensively over the last 15 years, and would consider myself an experienced psychonaut -- but while I'd always been interested, I didn't have the opportunity until recently to try DMT.\r\n\n\n\nI bought a glass pipe at a head shop with a tiny bowl and a squiggle in the stem, similar the drawing in Gracie & Zarkov's article. Before smoking, I spent part of the day watching videos about DMT and reading trip reports. I was a little concerned I was programming myself and given the typicalness of my experience I think I did program myself a bit. \r\n\n\n\nFor my first try, I filled it with about 40 mg of DMT (measured on a reasonably accurate scale). It took me a long time to get the DMT to melt and on my first go I didn't really get a good hit. I was surprised to find it hardly tasted as bad as I'd been lead to believe; I could really barely taste it except for my mouth going a bit numb (I think MDMA crystals taste 1000 times worse). Later, when I got a better hit, the taste didn't bother me at all, it almost had a slightly perfumed/anisette finish.\r\n\n\n\nAfter my first try, I felt just a tiny bit like I was coming down off of mushrooms for maybe 2 minutes. For a moment with my eyes closed I saw Alex Grey-type human circulatory patterns and thought 'Oh no, I hope this isn't all Alex Grey style!' I opened my eyes and my room was quite normal. My arms and chest felt heavy, and my stomach a bit woozy.\r\n\n\n\nIt was pretty frustrating, so I waited about 10 minutes and then measured out a larger dose (55mg +/- 5mg). This time I succeeded in getting it to vaporize much faster, but I didn't hold the first (biggest) lungful for very long and it was only with the second lungful that I remembered to keep it in and I finally managed to take off.\r\n\n\n\nI closed my eyes and was immediately pitched into deep space. \r\n\n\n\nFrom a great distance tiny points of light started shooting towards me exactly like any space movie. More and more points of light appeared and as one grew bigger and bigger I realized it was in the shape of a sitting Buddha. Although I was moving at 1000 miles per hour, the Buddha was massive and massively slow. I passed through the Buddha which was made of circuit patterns of light. I\u0092m not normally into Buddhas, but this was a distinctly welcoming Buddha. This Buddha was then joined by a thousand more Buddhas in a solid wall of sitting Buddhas that were flashing rainbow colors into infinity. I was playing a record of J.M. Jarre's 'Oxygene' and the high pitched beeps from the record were reflected in the flashing patterns on the Buddhas. I remembered very clearly an obelisk at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that has 1000 rows of Buddhas carved into it. In one eye I was standing in front of the obelisk at the museum, in the other eye I was microscopic and passing through this obelisk at a tremendous speed.\r\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the Buddhas, I was in a massive room carved with Egyptian hieroglyphics. I floated through this room at a slower pace. I passed in-between and through hieroglyphics that were much larger than me. I was probably as tall as one of their fingers, or a nose.  There were also Pyramids that were doll-house sized to me. They were all moving and interacting with each other, but paying me no mind. There was an overall yellow cast to the light and the objects in this room.\r\n\n\n\nI floated through a stone doorway and the next wing was mostly orange with silver and white accents and was decorated in a very 1970\u0092s, modular, cellular style. This room was on the same scale as my body \u0096 all of the furniture was formed out of the same material as the walls, floor ceiling \u0096 as if it had been cast as one piece. There was something labyrinthine about it, but also ultra modern (not 1970\u0092s but 3070\u0092s). In this room was a woman with dark hair and fair skin in I would guess her late 40\u0092s. She was dressed in the same material as the room. She didn\u0092t speak to me directly, but she knew I was there and there was nothing threatening about her. At about the moment I became aware of the woman I also realized that instead of flying forward, I was controlling my own movements. I started towards another door in the right corner of the 3070\u0092s room \u0096 it was also futuristic, but it was glowing silver with no orange. As I got to the room I only had a quick glance inside (silver and black mirrors) before I opened my eyes.\r\n\n\n\nI opened my eyes and my living room looked quite normal, with only a very slight weirdness to the lighting and enhanced colors. I tried to close my eyes again, but I found that I had slipped out of the vast museum complex and now I was back drifting through the stars, and seeing LSD-like patterns. They were pretty, but not nearly as exciting. \r\n\n\n\nThrough the entire experience I was aware of heaviness on my body, and the slow, labored breathing everyone talks about. At a certain point I had to cough but I suppressed it because I had a feeling a cough would tear through the tissue paper of my vision. At no point did I lose my sense of self or awareness that I was sitting on the couch in the living room. I felt like Alice when her head shoots up suddenly from her neck and her body stays tiny on the ground. \r\n\n\n\nThe physical effects wore off shortly after the mental effects disappeared. Less than twenty minutes later I ate dinner with no trouble, and my head felt clearer than it had before I smoked the DMT. \r\n\n\n\nIn retrospect I think two things really influenced my trip. I did use to take LSD at the Metropolitan Museum of Art a lot (about 10 years ago). Recently I\u0092ve been having a psychedelic renaissance, and I have been thinking about doing this again. Oddly, the thousand Buddha wall there never really engaged me at the time, but I think that as soon as I made that connection to the star-Buddhas in my vision, the rest of my experience took on a very Met-tinged/museum-y tone.\r\n\n\n\nThe second influence was 2001 Space Odyssey, which I watched again recently and I had been thinking about how DMT-like the last 10 minutes were. I think I definitely gave myself exactly what I was expecting as far as shooting beyond the infinite goes. Not that I\u0092m complaining, it was awesome.\r\n\n\n\nI will definitely be looking to this more extensively in the near future. There was nothing ominous or too uncomfortable about this experience. I feel like I only just crossed the threshold, and I am ready to go further."

        "report_text": "My first breakthrough experience with Dimethyltryptamine was the most profound altered state of consciousness I've ever experienced in my days thus far. More intense than all my long duration psychedelic tryptamine and phenehtylamine experiences combined. Most of my psychedelic experiences have had moments, even hours of out of body properties to them when one induced a trance like state, or practiced meditation, but I also have the ability to come back to your body at will in these states with compounds such as Psilocybin, LSD, or 4-AcO-DMT. The reality DMT imposes upon the explorer, is farther from conventional reality, and any psychedelic reality that I've ever experienced, and the amount of meaning it instilled in me left me confused, full of wonder, and reminded how much I don't know about time, space, and existence. I participated in the extraction of this compound and a laundry list of other alkaloids belonging to the mimosa rootbark, and was quite satisfied with the outcome and purity of the material. White and crystalline, an extreme indicator of high quality DMT. The correlation between DMT and visualization of dreams, birth, near death experiences, and even death fascinated me to no end, and the undeniable safeness of this compound made me even more comfortable in exploring. The only thing my array of psychedelic experience prepared me for with this experiment, was the acceptance of what's going on, and the idea of losing control of my body, in a mind/body separation sense. Most DMT experiences are inexplicable in a sense, even more so than a 'normal' psychedelic experience, but I will try to put the unspeakable into words. \r\n\n\n\n50mg of DMT was loaded into an oil burner in order to vaporize the material, and my companion was equipped with a torch burner to help me ingest. I held the oil burner in my mouth and watched as he vaporized the compound. It instantly melts into a puddle of slightly yellow tinted, yet transparent liquid, and the oil burner fills with vapor. I slowly inhale, and two seconds in I can feel a body high reminiscent of large amounts of marijuana, definitely a stoning effect at this point. \r\n\n\n\nHe continues to vaporize and by the second toke I can feel my body wanting to fly away, everything is shaking in my visual field. Exquisite alien patters manifest themselves everywhere. The walls, the carpet, my arms, my legs, all have this beautiful hue that instilled the feeling of being in tune with everything. Along with my ego, the room and all the material inhabitants are dissolving from reality, everything in my field of vision has transformed into one beautiful and perfectly geometric dimension. I have never witnessed such a profound change in reality with any psychedelic, and this is the first time I've experienced the dissolvement of actual things in my field of vision; they were no longer there. The patterns don't seem familiar to anything my sense organs have ever perceived before, but I am engulfed in this amazing feeling of nostalgia, and I am aware I have experienced this before, somehow. \r\n\n\n\nBy the third toke I can only see my friend in front of me, he's no longer an embodiment of every day reality. As I look at him I observe a warm smile, I am baffled at the amount of raw beauty energy pouring out of him. Something happened in these few seconds before my mind completely let go of my body, some sort of contact with an entity that used the person in front of me as a mediator. No words, no english, just feelings instilled into me from another place, and I could feel that it was coming from him. 'Everything is okay, try not to be astonished by this, don't give in to astonishment, you're going home, pay attention to what we show you.' \r\n\n\n\nNot hearing, but feeling these instructions instilled laughter in my psyche, I could not understand how one could not be amazed by any of this, but I sat and waited, like an interested child in grammar school, very attentive. About 15 seconds have passed at this point, from first toke to observing the visual world, to the mediation. \r\n\n\n\nDuring my fourth toke the torch burner fails to light and my buddy quickly grabs a normal lighter and ignited the oil burner. It explodes with smoke and vapor, and before I can finish inhaling I feel myself leaving my body, floating upward at first and then being violently pushed through what most DMT explorers refer to hyperspace. The music being played in the room, which was beautifully melodic and extremely emotional, paralleled where I was perfectly. The music never sounded distorted or extremely enjoyable in a LSD or psilocybin auditory experience sense, it was as if reality was kind of showing me the beauty in it's raw form. Though the music didn't sound different at all, it was the most beautiful thing I've ever experienced from an auditory and emotional point of view. I could tell my mind was in a different place in respect to my body, because the music definitely sounded distant, as if it was coming from a completely different place. \r\n\n\n\nThe vortex or tunnel I was flying through was filled with the most beautiful geometric patterns and grids, I traveled past these things too quickly to even take the time to observe anything. The amount of beauty in this place was unbelievable. I could feel my inner self, what I've gotten a glimpse of through psychedelic and meditation experience, more immensely then I ever thought possible. I was experiencing eternity, and it couldn't have been more ravishing or meaningful. As the song is dwindling to an end, I realize I am coming back to my body, just as rapidly as I left it. I open my eyes and watch things pop back into conventional reality very quickly, first the TV, then the laptop, then everything. My friend has left the room, unbeknownst to me, and he enters from his restroom door right as I glance in that direction. He is smiling and looking at me with a feeling of understanding, knowing where I just went. I am in complete awe of the experience, I cannot believe what just happened. The first question I mutter is, 'the first time I smoked DMT, were you playing that song?' He gives me a confused look because this is the first time I smoked DMT with him, and I smile and say sorry I worded that wrong, it felt like I had experienced all of those moments before, I do not know what to make of this.' \r\n\n\n\nI look at him and inform him that I feel like crying, and he instructs me to do so. I immediately start crying tears having to do with every possible emotion one could have, tears of the beauty, tears at what felt like the truth, tears of enlightenment, tears of appreciation for being alive still, and tears for the love being shared in that room. I cried for only a few moments, and told him the beauty of that experience was astonishing, and almost too much to witness. I look up at him after I finish crying, and he has his arms wide open for me with a big smile, and we embrace. Great vibes indeed. As I get up from my sitting position, I feel as if I'm floating, and I make my way to the porch. The scene was beautiful, I enjoyed a cigarette, and then we were off to gift the DMT to a few friends. The rest of the day I could not get my mind off what happened, I am definitely going to revisit this compound. It is just beautiful."

        "report_text": "It was the first day of the new year and some friends and I had indulged in rather large amounts of MDMA the night before.  I was at a friend's house all day recovering from the MDMA when I was offered to try some DMT.  The DMT had been extracted from Mimosa Hostilis and was white.  My friend had taken the extra step using a freezer to obtain a more pure product.  I was in a good mood, ready to try something off the wall for a change.  We had eaten a large breakfast to help us recover from the night before and I had taken about 30 mg of gingko biloba standardized extract, 100 mg of Coenzyme Q10, and a multivitamin/mineral with breakfast.  \r\n\n\n\nI have tried approximately 40 mg. DMT once before in smokeable form but I had never snorted it.  I was a little skeptical at first because I prefer the shorter duration of the smoked DMT experience.  I knew that DMT could be very intense from my previous experience and I felt more comfortable knowing that time is on my side incase things get too intense.  However we had no DMT pipe.  I felt the omens calling me that day to do it.  The first one was as we were just about to turn off the TV, someone on TV said 'break though'.  The second omen was the weather outside.  It was just perfect and beautiful.  I knew that I needed to conquer my fears of the DMT so I decided to do it this day, knowing that if I didn't, I would be disappointed at myself for letting fear get the best of me.  \r\n\n\n\nMy friend lined me up a fat line of 100 mg white fluffy DMT extract after weighing it.  It looked like a lot, about the size of a fat cocaine dagger.  He put on some very chill drum and bass, not to fast, not too dark.  It was light outside, but the lights in the room were turned off.  The TV was off and everything was quiet except for the music.  The music was like a continuous journey.  You couldn't really tell where the tracks ended or began unless you were familiar with the CD.  Just my friend, his girlfriend, and I were in the room and I was given a CD case with the fat DMT line and a home made tooter.  I sniffed the whole line into my left nostril.  It burned a little but it wasn't too bad. \r\n\n\n\nI felt nothing for a couple of minutes and then began to see some mild visuals.  Playful, entertaining visuals covered the ceiling of the room in green and yellow colors if I remember correctly.  I was at peace and had sort of forgotten that I had done DMT.  Then a couple minutes later I was visited by many beings, too many to count or even acknowledge them all.  Each of them would come and leave quick, and they kept coming.  I felt it was just best too relax and watch the scene because it would have been too hard to make sense of it all.  It was rather pleasant and at the same time a bit overwhelming.  The beings seemed to be studying me, all of them interested in something different, but I was not afraid.  No two beings were the same.  This part of the experience seemed pretty brief.  I think this was when I first left my body and was no longer aware of being in my friend's room.  \r\n\n\n\nThen I found myself experiencing the creation of mankind.  I sort of felt like Neo in the Matrix when he woke up with all of those tubes going into his body inside of the tub where humans were being made for energy sources, except there were no tubes and no machines or matter as we know it on Earth.  I was covered in a thick pink jelly like material and could not free myself.  I was not yet ready to be released because I had not fully matured enough to survive on my own.  The technology involved was very alien, not resembling anything like human technology.  I had the feeling that our creators were selfish for creating us, but that it is still good to be alive as a human none the less.  Why did I feel that our creation was out of selfishness at the time? I don't know, but maybe in some secret way, we were created to unknowingly serve our creators.  None the less, I felt that they were okay with us enjoying life to its fullest but I don't think they cared if we didn't.  I felt trapped there.  I couldn't move anything except my jaw.  It was too much for me to handle comfortably and I waited patiently for this part of the experience to pass.  \r\n\n\n\nI continued floating around in the 3 dimensional DMT space without anything too significant happening when I was found by a very advanced extraterrestrial being.  His kind liked humanity and they enjoyed helping humans evolve at a very fast rate.  I could feel this being empowering me and showing me advanced things.  He helped direct my awareness to different things, all of which were helpful to my evolution.  Anytime my awareness shifted to something of no use, especially things that would enable fear, he would give me a nudge to not pay attention to it but to focus on the useful things that were good for me.  He also could sense weaknesses in me as I brought them up from out from my consciousness and would helped me overcome them.  At the same time this being was learning from his interaction with me.  It was a positive experience.  I learned that these beings existed among another type of beings and that they did not like each other, but instead of fighting, they just avoided one another in a respectful way, knowing that engaging in problems was a waste of time.  They knew what they wanted and applied themselves fervently to related tasks.  \r\n\n\n\nThe next part of the experience was the most frightening.  I experienced the return of Jesus Christ as it is written in the bible.  I am an atheist, but I still have some biblical/ religious material in my subconscious mind from when I used to be Christian.  This is what happened: Time stopped, the music I was listening to is very repetitive so it can give one the sense that whatever is happening will happen for eternity when on powerful hallucinogens.  I experienced Jesus returning and at first it was awesome.  I felt that all of existence was connected to this one moment and that everyone knew that Jesus had returned.  It was very intense and everyone surrendered themselves.  At first I believed that we were all waking up in heaven, learning how to use our heavenly bodies, but then I sensed that something terrible was about to happen.  That terrible thing was judgement.  I began judging myself, thinking about all of my imperfections and I realized that I was about to be sent to an eternity in hell.  I cried and tried very hard to find some good in myself to latch onto, to show Jesus that although I didn't deserve heaven, I was not fit for hell.  I felt what it would be like to have your entire family stripped from you for all eternity, to be left in a place of torment and suffering with others who are also in misery.  It was very very brutally intense and I honestly believed that this was going to last forever.  \r\n\n\n\nFinally that part passed and I began to open my eyes again.  I could finally recognize the room that I was in and my two friends sitting there in total silence.  I was relieved  but the experience was not yet over.  I was finally aware of the existence of time and realized that the drug would eventually weak off.  I began to move to the music harmoniously in repetitive motions like a slithering snake, as I lay in the same place on my friend's bed.  It felt very nice, and I had the feeling like this was expected of me from my friends, like it was normal thing to do on DMT.  It just came naturally and I couldn't resist doing it.  It was therapeutic.  This continued through the music track that was playing. \r\n\n\n\nThen came this entity/demon or whatever that tried to posses me.  It was coercing me to become its sex slave.  It offered me great things for my surrender and threatened bad things for my refusal.  A battle took place between me and this sexual demon.  I refused to allow my existence to be in the hands of something that was against my own desires.  It was an all out battle and the victor would be in control of me for the rest of my life, maybe even for eternity.  I fought to the death and it wasn't fun, but I was the victor.  \r\n\n\n\nThen I began to fear that I was dying.  I felt like I didn't deserve to live.  I felt like I had been rejected by my friends and something was trying to make me believe that I didn't even love my family.  I felt that I had been given too many chances at life and that this was it.  I had made the last mistake and I had to pay for it.  I tried hard to stay alive.  I thought about all of the reasons why I should live, all of the things I could do to be more healthy.  I began to breath like a yogi or some spiritual master, imagining oxygen going throughout my entire body especially into parts that needed it most.  I rolled around on my friend's bed, stretching, breathing, rolling off of the bed, getting into different positions to aid the oxygen flow throughout my body, cracking my bones and meditating.  (This is something that I have been doing on shrooms for many years.  Its an intuitive healing process that I love, and one of my favorite benefits of doing shrooms.  It seems to be a gift of the tryptamines, at least for me, and I usually begin to do it towards the end of an experience.) I remembered that no one has ever died from DMT and that helped me realized that I was just panicking a bit.  I tried to relax as I awaited my return to baseline.  \r\n\n\n\nFinally I was able to stand up, and I felt great.  I felt like I had just peaked on an eighth of mushrooms, you know the feeling like you have just been born again with a clear mind, quick, wise, intuitive and powerful.  I looked in the mirror and my pupils were still very large.  I didn't really feel like I did MDMA the night before anymore and I had a very optimistic outlook on the new year.  I am glad I conquered my fear of DMT and accepted the challenge.  Even though this experience was very intense at times pretty difficult, I am glad I did it and I may do it again when I feel up to it, but I think I will stick to smoking.  The experience lasted too long for my liking.  DMT is not a toy.  It was not a fun experience but I like the challenge of such things from time to time.  The afterglow was great and as more time goes by, I think about the experience a little more and realize the how intense it really was.  Its been 24 hours since the trip and my nose is finally feeling better.  I believe I broke through this time.  All in all the trip lasted about an hour according to my friends.  They said that they have never seen anyone trip so hard off of 100 mg insufflated dose.  Why? perhaps because of the MDMA the night before or the supplement combo I took earlier.  Maybe I am sensitive to DMT or I may have just had some things in my subconscious mind that enabled for a stronger more demanding trip."

        "report_text": "This happened at the OZORA festival a couple of days ago. Before this LSD and MDA were the only hallucinogens I had used. DMT has been on my mind for a while. I read DMT: The Spirit Molecule about six months ago and had seen Enter the Void a couple of times. I was immensely curious about it and really interested in what I could learn from it. My last couple of trips on LSD were very spiritual and I was really ready for something more.\r\n\n\n\nSo, my friend and I were chilling at the festival one evening, hanging out on the grass with all the hippies. There were lots of people playing around, tripping, up to random things. My friend and I were having a laugh trying to decipher their conversations. Earlier we had shared a chocolate energy ball that was laced with LSD. I could feel it having a slight effect, but I assumed the dosage plus our tolerance meant that it would have minimal influence. Yes, the first time I smoked DMT I was already on LSD. A young emo looking guy came over and asked us if we wanted any changa. I was like, what is changa? Some crazy new drug we have never heard of? He explained that it was DMT. I knew the moment had come. DMT had found me. I was totally ready for whatever it would bring.\r\n\n\n\nThe guy was very attractive: young, tanned, calm, huge brown eyes, straight black hair with an emo fringe. He explained about the stuff, how it was healing, about how MAOI inhibitors were mysterious, how it went well with shrooms. He explained that you could repeat the dosage, if you did it again straight away there would be no tolerance. He explained it saying that the door stays open for a while; this was a nice idea. It made even more sense to me afterwards. The changa came in a tea bag: super stealthy the guy explained. I was unimpressed, I had no idea what DMT should look or smell like and didn't want to waste the 35 eur we had spent on 10 doses. He asked if we wanted to smoke it now, but I had to go find some saffi for my chillum first. This proved difficult, and meant asking a lot of random hippies for scissors and gauze. Eventually we were ready. The guy had already left, so I went up to the top of the hill with my two friends to get some space for my hit. I wanted somewhere quiet and dark, with the stars. Not that that would make any difference when the stuff came on.\r\n\n\n\nI loaded the chillum. Apprehensive I took a toke. There was a slight zooming in and out effect of the trees above me, but that was it. Not enough, but the stuff was definitely real and would work. \r\n\n\n\nOK, time to try this shit for real. I think I had to load the chillum again, and had two more tokes before it happened. I held it in and tried to prepare. Nothing could prepare me for what happened. Yes I read the entirety of DMT: The Spirit Molecule, but there was nothing that could describe this experience. The colours came on quickly. I was lying down. I put my arm over my eyes and went into it. I had time to say, 'Yes, it's definitely working', before I was sucked in.\r\n\n\n\nThe visuals were some of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life. I knew I had to remember this experience. They got more and intense. They were focused around the centre, entirely symmetrical along four or more axes like a kaleidoscope. But flowing and moving in smooth patterns. The colours were vibrant, like neon in a way, but not glowing, more like the saturation was turned up to transcendent. They were mainly green at the centre, but with red curves around the sides. The red curved shapes were kind of like the patterns you find inside a tomato, with circles of black inside the curves. The centre was a rotating radiating mass of legs or tentacles, reaching out in a spiraling movement. The centre and the whole thing in fact was constantly moving and changing, radiating outwards, always focusing towards the centre. \r\n\n\n\nI knew at the centre there was a presence. The waving limbs were dancing in some tribal, primitive way. A little like the Hindu god Kali, but not angry or destructive. It was definitely female and powerful. I will try to explain what it was like. Very ancient. Ancient like the stars, like the earth. This entity was at the centre of existence. It had great power. It wasn't like the light of love and the universe you feel like LSD. It was outside of that. Outside of our universe. Definitely the feeling of something from space. This wasn't light. This was the darkness of outer space. This was hyperspace and in it was this ancient very alien being. If I had one word to describe DMT it is alien. Like the an incest mind. Analytic, rational, unemotional, unblinking. I knew there was no escaping it. I had entered it's realm and now the entirety of the ancient mind was focused on me. It wasn't malevolent, just impossible to understand its intentions. It could definitely go either way.\r\n\n\n\nI was trying to remember what I had read from DMT: The Spirit Molecule while this was happening, but it was hard to concentrate on anything under the intensity, I tried to go with the visuals, trying to relax into like an LSD trip. However, nothing had prepared me for the overwhelming intensity of DMT, the beauty of the visuals and the sheer power of this force trying to suck me into hyperspace. I knew from trip reports that there was more and I was wondering if I was really was going to be catapulted off the planet. There was definitely the feeling that the entity wanted you to go further. You were under its gaze and it was intently interested in you. Submitting to something so alien was immensely difficult. I was curious but also scared. I went as far as I could but there was a tension, the force completely demanded your attention. It was beautiful, but a kind of terrible beauty. I guess this is what surprised me the most, I had spent the last couple of days doing LSD surrounded by hippies in this loving, sensitive environment, full of smiles love and a kind of joyful fun. But DMT was serious, it wasn't interested in the loving light, it was outside of that, outside of everything human, it was something above the unity of existence in this plane. \r\n\n\n\nI was trying to get an impression of how quickly time was passing outside of the visions. I could hear the music going on from the festival, we could hear the chillout stage and they were playing nice ambient for the mood. From the rhythm I could tell that my sense of time was not so messed up. Time was passing at a relatively normal rate outside. Focusing on anything other than visuals was difficult. I was completely unaware of my body. Experimentally I reached my fingers into the dirt were I was lying. The ground was still there. It was good to feel the earth. It was a powerful connection to this dimension, I was reassured that while my mind was in hyperspace with the aliens, I was still a being of this planet and it was good to know that there the organic forces of life and earth were there, all around and inside of me. By this time the DMT must have come down a little. I knew I wasn't going to get sucked off the planet this time so I enjoyed the rest of the visuals while they lasted. They continued with the same intensity for quite a long time, longer than I had expected. I knew that I could open my eyes and break the trance to an extent if I wanted. After a while the beautiful flowing colours and spaces started to dissipate. They started to recede gradually, the forms were smaller and there was blackness appearing between the moving shapes. They were still immensely vibrant, even the black background had a vibrancy, if black could radiate. \r\n\n\n\nI decided to open my eyes. I lept up, exclaiming, 'Oh my god that was incredible'. I felt reborn. I wondered why DMT is described as a near death experience. This was not death, this was immediate, total and complete rebirth of the mind and personality. Feeling around in my thoughts I found a complete new state. I was actually a different person. This was unexpected and new. Maybe this is what the dealer meant by it being very healing. Everything around me was new as well. Not the wonder and awe of LSD, the world had not changed, I had changed, it was liberating and an amazing experience. I dancing around a little, enjoying the music and the trees and life. How quickly DMT could have this effect was astounding, imagine condensing the personal change of an LSD trip lasting over 10 hours into only 10 or 20 minutes. I knew for sure that I would do DMT again. In, fact I felt I could do it again immediately. I packed the pipe for my friend and got him sorted out with the chillum. This is where things kind of started to take a turn to the weird.\r\n\n\n\nWhat I am going to describe now was the most uncomfortable part of DMT for me and it is taking a lot of effort for me to put it down here in words. I don't want to remember this feeling. Even thinking about it is uncomfortable for me. I started to get these really junkie vibes. I started getting the fear. I was so completely amazed by the DMT experience was eager to repeat it. I could tell my friend felt the same. I was worried that this stuff was actually super addictive and I had made some terrible mistake, that I was going to keep doing this immensely strong hallucinogen until I broke my mind. This was combined with a kind of unexpected dissociative effect. I felt really distant from everything, from the party, from my two friends. I was wondering if they were feeling the same effect and didn't particularly want to be around them if they were. I know what it is like to be depressed, this was different. It was not sadness, but an infinite distance between me and everything that was going on around me. I was trying to reach out for something that would give me some positive emotional response, but all the usual things, hugging my friends, smoking joints and cigarettes and dancing to the music didn't help.  So, I started looking around for some good vibes. \r\n\n\n\nWe went back to the party and to be with all the people and the light and the music. I knew we had to go off in search of some change in scenery. It felt too junkie here in the dark on top of this hill smoking obscure life changing drugs. It was really hard to feel anything except the emptiness and distance from everything around me. I rolled a joint and smoked the whole thing without passing it. I have never before committed such a terrible breach of joint etiquette, but this was serious. I rolled another and kept it stuck in my mouth for some security as we walked. I kept the parts of myself that I could under control and we made our way to the chillout tent. Lying down, listening to the music and feeling around I understood what was going on. The LSD my friend and I had eaten earlier had kicked in. I knew I could deal with this, I just needed to dial into the light of the universe. I knew if I chilled the fuck out and concentrated, the love of universe would be out there waiting for me, just enjoy the sensations and go with it.\r\n\n\n\nIt turned around pretty quickly after that. I spent the rest of the night dancing to the chill out music, then taking a walk around the festival, checking out the main stage and fire dancers. I met a Hungarian guy walking through the corn fields, we flirted and had some laughs, talking about how great the festival was. The rest of the LSD was a really pleasant mellow vibe, a nice feeling of wonder and beauty without being overwhelming. \r\n\n\n\nThe rest of the night I tried to think back about the DMT, but it was almost physically impossible. Like the memory was locked in another part of my brain. I didn't worry about it. I figured I would have plenty of time later to understand it. By the time morning came I was able to unravel a few things. I stayed up talking the ear off my friend, awake and talkative for hours with the LSD. \r\n\n\n\nThe next day we planned to do DMT again. I knew there was more out there and that it would be waiting for me. It was the last full day of the festival, so it was either do it then or smuggle the changa back home (probably not entirely impossible). However, smoking it the next day was way less effective. I don't know whether the changa got damp over night, or I had some tolerance or something, or how much of an influence the LSD the previous day had. It took four tokes and loading the chillum twice to get any effect. Then there was only monochrome visuals of faint tentacley, sea urchin type things, similar to the opening part of Enter the Void, but less vivid or detailed. It was disappointing, but I already had one amazing powerful experience to take back with me, so I was not too concerned. Again afterwards there was the disassociated feeling from the people around me but I knew sticking a cigarette in my mouth, smoking a joint and drinking would chai would help it pass. \r\n\n\n\nThe DMT experience feels very real. The facts are that I smoked a powerful drug and had an intense experience. But I can't equate that with my personal experience of it, it was so intensely real. I know with solid conviction that that force is out there. For me it is a real thing. When I trip on LSD the feelings, experiences and visions I have on are realish. I treat them the same as stories or myths. They might not having an existence in this reality, but they influence the world through my thoughts and memories. I can use what I have learned on LSD to improve my own life and hopefully bring some good into the world. But DMT is different. The intensity of it is so incredible that it feels absolutely real. I have been thinking about it over the last couple of days, and always I have the sensation that what I experienced did actually happen out there in hyperspace, outside of existence. The being and the void are real, it is still there. If I want to go back some time in the future, it will be waiting. It's a little ominous, but I know there is great beauty and a truly amazing experience out there. \r\n\n\n\nHowever, for the moment I think I need a little more grounding before I go back. After a week of LSD, endless joints, MDMA and the occasionally nitrous I definitely need to stay on this planet and do some grounding for a while or things might go completely sideways.\r\n\n\n\nReading back on this report I might make it seem like DMT was a bit of a negative experience for me. I don't think this is really true, it was challenging and weirder than anything I have ever experienced, but it was intense and unforgettable in a good way. I'm not sure yet what I can take away from it, I think over time and after trying it again I will be able to put some perspective into it. It has definitely made me more respectful of Ayahuasca, I won't be so glib going into that trip, an extended experience of that type would require a really clean, open and unafraid mind if it is anything like smoked DMT."
